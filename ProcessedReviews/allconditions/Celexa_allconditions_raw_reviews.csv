1$Condition: Anxiousness associated with Depression$12/2/2019 9:03:25 PM$Reviewer: MyLife, 25-34 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$2$5$On and off, Mostly on for 3 or so years. 1stly, effects were noticed by others before noticed by myself. Weight loss due to loss of appetite and then mild weight gain once I started feeling a little more care free. This 'drug' definitely helped with my anxiety. It made me overall very positive. Not 100% better but way more bearable. Helped with getting angry. All was great until I started to continuously notice this lack of empathy, cloudiness In what felt like my frontal lobe, my sex drive severely dropped, and then this major suicidal depression came like a freight train for some reason. Honestly It bummed me out but I knew getting off it was for the better. Now that I have been off of it for a few months, I like the natural feeling better. I think. My anxiety is back but I feel like I can deal with it better. My thoughts come easier. My memory is better.. It feels more 'real.'  However I still have a depressing cloud that lingers over me But SO much better then what was happening to me towards the end. I miss not getting angry so easy and the ease of having positive thoughts. However Im hoping that this experience has helped me learn how to balance things on my own without the help of a prescription. Overall it 'worked great,' My dosage might have needed to be changed. It could be the stressful but Im confident that being off medication is more the type of life I wanna live. 
2$Condition: Depression$9/5/2019 9:38:46 PM$Reviewer: 45-54 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $2$1$2$"My doctor prescribed me 20mg Citalopram for depression.  After a few weeks, there was some improvement, but I felt the drug helped my anxiety more than the depression.  The dose was increased to 40mg.  Still felt ""lopsided"", in that the anxiety was under control but not the depression.  This drug clouded my judgement, as I said some things and felt like I put my foot in my mouth!  Very embarrassing! I mentioned these things to my doctor.  She said Citalopram is more for anxiety than it is for depression. My doctor switched me to another drug, which is helping alot."

15$Condition: Posttraumatic Stress Syndrome$7/28/2018 4:10:34 PM$Reviewer: 55-64 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$5$3$I am somewhat happy with the medication Citalopram HBR 20MG which I have recently been increased to 30MGs. I used to work in corrections, but now work as a security officer. However, whilst working security March 15, 2015 in an apartment complex, I was lured into the parkade due to a fire alarm where 6 men were waiting for Me. I have since suffered from night terrors, but refused to be a victim so I returned to work for 1 year, then the depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts came. Workers comp had Me see a PTSD Psychologist right after the attack for 2 visits, then had Me see him again. He diagnosed Me with delayed onset post traumatic stress, however WCB will only look at the physical aspects of the attack, not the psychological ones. I have now voluntarily been admitted to the psych ward due to wanting to end My life and the Psychiatrist here has put Me on Citalopram. The night terrors have not stopped at all, but I've learned a new coping method by looking for something particular in the room (like My chair) as a grounding to let Me know that I am not at work and the attack is not real. Since taking the 30 Mg of Citalopram the thoughts of ending my life have ceased greatly. Iind myself a lot happier, yet am tired more.

I couldn't sleep or eat, and I essentially went ""down the rabbit hole"" and couldn't get out. I was a total wreck and had an extremely difficult time working and doing general tasks. My doctor put me on a new drug (at that time): Celexa. It wasn't long and I began sleeping well and functioning better. After 3 months, I was able to get off of them. I haven't had the need to take anti-depressants since that time. I highly recommend it... it definitely worked for me!"

When I commented to my md about how I felt about Citalopram, he said ""it's like somebody hit the pause button"" just long enough to let it bounce off you."

The first couple of weeks on the drug were difficult, but it was nothing I couldn't deal with. I yawned a lot, felt less inhibited, and a tiny bit dizzy.

After the side effects wore off, and making sure I took my medication everyday, I can now say I feel much better.

If I take too large of a dose I end of tired and unfocused.  I end up cutting the pills to a 1mg dose and at that level I can tolerate the side effects and still benefit from the drug.  Unfortunately, even at this trivial dose I have a significant sexual side effect.  At times I've stopped the drug for months and the side effect still remains, I fear it may have become permanent.  Now I need to go back on the med, but I'm hesitant because I'm so worried about this side effect.

I was barely able to function. It worked at 10mg for a while, then once my baby was born, my dosage was increased to 20mg. I continued to take that dosage for about 2 years until I finally told my doctor that I don't notice a difference in my life and she then upped the dosage to 40mg. Now, I experience anxiety worse than before, along with insomnia and zero sexual interest. My husband and I have not been intimate in 6 months because of this. I see a new doctor next week and I honestly can't wait to try something different.

But seeing a counselor helped me the most and have come to terms with my crisis event. After 2.5 months, I have stopped taking Celexa. I talked to my pharmacist and the side effects (for me) were multiple and harsh. Nausea, dizziness, diarrhea and the worst was the trembling in my hands. I thought I was getting Parkinsons!

With any medication there are side effects. I am so anti medication and tried herbal or alternative medication. However with severe anxiety and depression this medication has helped me get back on track in life. I was very anxious about taking the medication but now I am taking it I wish I'd done it sooner. You do need to be patient to see results and also tolerate the side effects because in the long run the benefit of this medicine outweighs the minor side effects. It works for me but maybe not for everyone, however it's worth a try as doctors wouldn't prescribe something without benefiting you and making you better.

Unfortunately, it did very little for my OCD, and I did not notice much benifit from citalopram for OCD. It helped the suicidal tendancies a little bit, but not very much. I took 40mg once per day. Personally, I think this tablet is more for anxiety more than anything else. People with generalised anxiety disorder would probably benefit best from this tablet, but everyone is different.
The side-effects I had were increased sweating, sleepiness, increased salivation, memory problems, strange dreams, tiredness, trembling, and yawning. These side-effects lasted about 5 - 10 days, then they went, except for the strange dreams, that lasted about 4 months, which I loved. The dreams that citalopram caused me made me look forward to going to bed. To be honest, citalopram was a good tablet, just not quite strong enough."

I started at 10mg, then uped to 20mg which is what my dr recommended me at. I have had severe depression since before I hit puberty and am now 24, almost 25 (I hit puberty at around 9-10). I suffered through my entire per-adult life and well into the beginning of it. I finally took control iPad started this medication. Talking therapy didn't work. Everything I tried didn't work. Finally, after about 6-8 months on this medication (yes really) I feel fantastic. I've never been happier. I don't remember feeling this great. Its like I actually see colors again. I'm trying to stop this medication now, since I think I can finally deal without it (it's been Bout a year) and I'm having a bit of a difficult time with it though. I'm still feeling good but I get crazy moody bouts of ANGER. I have really no reason to be angry but everything is just enraging!! It's very frustrating. I hope it goes away soon but I would recommend quitting the meds as SLOWLY as possible to fight the mood swings. I had no real side affects on this medication except for craving for sweets and a harder time to orgasm (but when I did it was awesome lol).

I have to agree with many on the fact that it is VERY hard to try to get off of this medication. Unfortunately, for me I am better staying on ot. I use it because I just feel out of control when I am not taking it and a cry easily when not on it. I just pray that anyone searching for help gets the help that they need. It has helped me but, with any medication there are most always side effects. Blessings to all!

I went back to my doc after a week to say how I am now fatigued who said try taking at night.  So I began taking 1tab a day at night, before bed.  I then started to have consistent very vivid (nightmarish) dreams.  Fortunately this lasted 2weeks.  Id also wake up tired and take a while to get into my day.  I was crabby and could get annoyed very easily, then Id be happy and spritely by midmorning. I went back to the docs again.  This time he said, take 1/2 a tab in the morning.  I did this for about 4-6weeks and noticed that this was helpful.  Although, I could feel in my body when the 24hours was up as I begin to have blurriness and feel lethargic mentally.  I went back to my doc for a last time who said, ok, change to 1/2 a tab at night. I have been on half a tab for the past year now. (weight is 52-58kg.  fluctuates.  Average weight 56kg) I still dislike taking medication and I want to stop.

I highly recommend this anti-depressant for depression sufferers. 

I have never felt so normal in such a long time. But I developed a weird sleep problem. I'd sleep 14 hours a night. I couldn't get out of bed otherwise. I don't know if it's my condition or if it was Cipralex. 

I could only fully and actively function for a good 2-3 hours each day. Other times, I was sleepy and tired. Just constantly fatigued. 

I talked to my doctor about trying Prozac and he thought it was a good experiment. But I'm very hesitant after seeing the plentiful terrible reviews on WebMD of Prozac. 

Maybe I should stick with this sleeping problem than risk all of those seemingly commonly experienced side effects."

Any who, I stopped taking the Citalopram after week 3 (and a 1/2) and went back to Cymbalta. My reasons for the switch are this. #1 I became increasingly forgetful or would blank out very important work details. Not like me at all to forget jobs! #2 I started to have involuntary muscle tightening. #3 I yawned uncontrollably at times. Other than those problems it did help my anxiety but it was not the answer for me. I was able to work through the sleeplessness at early morning Hours I had listed in my first review and noticed no other side effect. But the ones I did experience were unacceptable. So I guess I will shell out the big bucks for the med that is right for me. "

127$Condition: Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$5/5/2014 10:20:59 AM$Reviewer: Kat, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$3$5$I was on Cymbalta several years ago for depression and anxiety due to life experiences and I felt as I should. I felt ok, still with emotion but ok and not overwhelmed. I moved to a new state 7 years ago and could not afford my med for a very long time due to layoffs, no insurance, etc. I have recently been able to go back and restart on Citalopram after realizing that I still suffer from anxiety, occasional panic attacks, slight depression and irritability. I am only on day 3...... Day 1; Took 20mg on Friday night before bed, woke up at 3am and could not get back to sleep (this to me is very upsetting because I have struggled for the last few years with sleep issues and recently purchased a new tempurpedic mattress that has totally fixed that problem, now I'm back to not sleeping all night)  I was lethargic and made very deliberate and slow moves all day, although I felt fine. Day 2; Same problem after taking it at night woke up between 3 and 5 AM and could not get back to sleep. The rest of the day however, I felt just fine, no more grogginess just normal. Day 3; Woke up again at 4/5 am but had taken a melatonin before I went to bed and I was able to fall back asleep. Tonight,  I will be taking the melatonin earlier this evening and my 20mg Citalopram right before I close my eyes! So far I feel fine except I did realize when I drink coffee on an empty stomach I get very tired and once I eat I fell fine again. I haven't had any major irritability, stress or anxiety since taking this but still a few weird and uncomfortable thoughts, which is mild for my incredibly over active brain. I am also having hot/cold flashes but it isn't that bothersome. So far, so good.  It has also completely curbed my nicotine urge which is fantastic since I was on my 11 attempt to quit. I absolutely need more time to see if this med follows through or falls short and will revisit my review in another 3 weeks.

It didn't help as much as he said it would but it did help a bit.  I would say it made me more balanced.  It didn't exactly make me happy but it took most of my bad thoughts away.  I didn't want to be stuck taking a medication the rest of my life so I stopped taking it to see if I could do without.  Bad idea.  Terrible side effects for 2-3 weeks.  I was dizzy the whole time and got headaches. Not to mention the bad episodes were back.  After the dreaded few weeks the side effects went away but I was still sad.  So finally 6months later I saw a new Dr. who just put me on 20mg Prozac, I'm sure it will be like the same thing.

I worried so much that I couldn't enjoy life because I was too busy worrying about what horrible thing might be getting ready to happen.  I would have panic attacks at night that were so bad it felt as if I was on fire, the day time panic attacks were not as bad as the ones at night, but still were bad enough.  I'm not really sure why I was hesitant to take something, but my doctor told me all this medicine would do is turn off the noise in my head.  I started out on 10 mg, then changed to 20 mg after a week.  I could tell a difference in that I wasn't worrying as much, but the anxiety was still there lurking, and still bad at night.  He increased my dosage to 40 mg and everything has been much better.  I don't feel any different except that I am not worring myself sick.  Now my worries and controllable and rational.  This medicine has made a huge positive change in my life.  As for side effects, I was very sleepy when I began taking it, but after about a month and a half it's not very bad.  I sleep well, no problem there.  I have a bit of dry mouth, but I just dring more water which is better for me anyway.  The side effects are so minimal and the medicine works great.  I only wish I would have taken my doctor's advice and started taking it earlier, it would have saved me a lot of anxiety.

I don't want to go too fast. You are meant to increase it slowly to avoid the side affects. Only meant to take 20mg for all patients. some side effects on 5mg-sleepy, a bit of nausea, but feeling less stressed. I am concerned that my doctor didn't say to start slowly on them. I told my pharmacist that I'd had bad effects from amitriptyline years ago and that I wanted to start really slowly. She said 3 days with 5 mg.. then 3 days with 10mg, then 20 mg after that. I am not gonna risk that! Plus my driving has been a bit affected at 5mg. Start slow people. And if having bad side affects go back to your doctor to change the medication. Hope you all feel better soon, and be kind to yourselves and tell friends and loved ones how they can support you at this time.

I should have had the testosterone issue treated properly, but they insisted I used an ineffective testosterone gel. A year ago I found out that getting testosterone injections was far more effective and less expensive than androgen.  by then I was hooked on Celexa/Citalopram. I eventually weaned myself off of anti depressants, (thanks to medical mj which helped immensely, and I no longer need that) - but after 3 weeks off celexa, and my test levels normal, I had the biggest spiritual breakthru in my life. My gut feeling is BigPharma does not care about the condition of your soul, they just want to make money.  Anti depressants are only for people who absolutely need them or will die. I would do everything in my power to treat the real cause of depression, and not use an anti depressant. NEVER AGAIN for me. At age 58, my soul is finally free and I am back to normal and happy now

260$Condition: Depression$2/13/2013 9:24:58 AM$Reviewer: StillAlive, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$"This wonderdrug is a lifesaver! I was unbelievably low, started taking it, and could not believe the positive results!

In retrospect, I discovered that I have been depressed most of my life. After hitting a major low, I asked my doctor for help, and he prescribed Celexa (Citalopram).

The only ""negative"" side effect is extremely low sex drive (on a scale of 1 to 10, about 0.5). However, considering how life is now worth living, I hardly even care! You probably can't understand unless you've experienced it...

For people just starting to take Celexa (or Citalopram), I suggest starting with no more than 10 mg in the morning. Don't take it at night! The side effects I experienced by starting off with 20 mg at night might not have been caused by the medication (according to my doctor), but I suggest that you take no chances: start in the morning with or after breakfast. Keep in mind that there is a light at the end of the tunnel, and it is NOT a train coming at you!"

In fact I had people telling my I looked depressed.  I was also placed on Lorizapam for anxiety which works great. I continued to take the Citalopram at my doctors advise but I still experienced the same level of depression. After four months on the medication I still have trouble sleeping at night. If I miss a dose i have the worse headache. The biggest issue for me is that it is VERY hard to orgasm if at all.

Now i'm irritable and agitated frequently (let me note that my son is a Happy baby!), I have no concentration, I can never get enough sleep whether its 6 or 10 hours, and my sexual desire is long gone. And once again, I'm back to my emotional breakdowns. I can't even hold my composure at work anymore :(  I'm gonna try going back down to 20 mg. If that doesn't work, i'm gonna have to switch..

On the plus side, the meds have definitely eased the urge to drink. The down side is I have headaches every single day. Hard to say whether they are due to alcohol withdrawal or citalopram, but taking Tylenol eases the pain. It has made me slightly constipated, I was hoping to lose weight since I cut out the alcohol, but I've stayed the same. The worst side effect is that I'm tired all the time! I feel like I'm walking around in a fog and am totally un-motivated to do anything above the bare minimum.

Since my mother was chronically depressed her whole life and so was her mother I decided to stay on the drug and lower the dose to 10mg/day.  Eureka!  Smoothed out my emotions and lets me feel normal. I have a low tolerance for drugs so this seems to be a more than adequate dosage to alleviate my symptons.  Less can be more. I have been taking this for over 5 years and I am just starting to have sweating and insomnia issues that are not menopausal. I shower more and read alot to get sleepy.  I have had problems with rashes when I don't hydrate effectively and wear poyester clothing. Easy fix, drink more, wear cotton and stay cool. Overall this drug does the job that Zoloft couldn't.

I stopped taking it after 5 days.  I was prescribed this medication in order to combat grief symptoms and anxiety after the death of both of my parents.  I had high hopes, as I had never been on an anti-depressant and was hoping this might make me feel like ""me"" again so that I could do everyday activities without getting stressed and exhausted.  It did improve my quality of sleep and I woke up refreshed and energized, but I would ""crash"" later in the day, a few hours before I was to take my next dose.  It was how I imagine a drug user's ""highs"" and ""lows"" to be, on a milder level.  I had compulsive suicidal thoughts on this medication, and because of this I probably should have told someone I was taking it (I meant for my use of this drug to be private).  Nothing I would act on, but the compulsive thoughts were there.  After having one, I remember thinking to myself, ""woah, I can't believe I just thought that.""  I was almost more anxious on this med and the boomerang effect on my mood was just too much.  May work for some, but not for my particular case."

I've increased my dosage to 30mg and found my ""red"" anger poking through.  I've since reduced to 20mg and found it just as effective for depression (as 30mg).  Even keel.  Sadness is apparant at times, but no face-down on the floor depression.  Considering tapering off to check weight gain (18 lbs).  Could be meds, could be age."

477$Condition: Panic Disorder$8/28/2011 4:35:41 PM$Reviewer: AMS1010, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$3$I started taking Celexa for major panic attacks that flipped my life upside-down. I took the medication and it helped me for the first few months, but after about 2 months on Celexa it started to effect other parts of my life. Sex was not an option, it took away any desire I had, and when I did my mind wasn't there. I began to find myself zoning off for long periods of time, feeling like a droid. I decided I didn't want to be on it and told my doctor, she asked if I still battled with my anxiety and panic disorder and I told her it was still present but not as bad. She decided it was time to up my dose to 40 milligrams. I took the 40 MG for about 2 months and the zoning out and zombied out feeling was still there, I couldn't be intimate, and I decided to go off the medication without notifying my doctor. I stopped taking it cold turkey and experienced major brain spaces, periods of time where I couldn't think, almost like my brain was having a seizure. I would get light headed and felt sick, and had emotional break downs and vivid horrible dreams for a while. I decided I should taper off the medication, took my 20 MG instead of 40 and slowly stopped taking it. I am doing well, am not battling with myself anymore and I can think straight for the first time in almost a year. I believe the medication played a role in my recovery, but doesn't come without other battles.

So if any men out there are having this problem.It's not you it's the medication.I had always climaxed everytime I had sex before I started taking this medication.With me I have to consider changing my medication.My girlfriend is getting pissed and doesn't understand the side effects.

At first, it worked ok and didn't have any side effects.  Yet, after a year of being on this medication, I have noticed that I don't enjoy anything in my life and all of my relationships are slowly deteriorating.  This medication has also made me extremely tired, lose focus at work, and gain over 40 lbs in the past year-this is very uncharcteristic since I only gained about 1 to 2 lbs a year before taking Citalopram.  After a major spell of depression while being on citalopram, I decided to ask my doctor to change my medication. I am now taking Wellbutrin for only 2 days so far and already feel better and more hopeful about life(dr. said Wellbutrin is an NDRI which affects the brain differently than SSRI meds like Citalopram).  I hope the Wellbutrin works.

I decided after a severe anxiety attack 3 months ago to take the pills prescribed I started at 10mg for a month and saw marked improvement in my mood and a decrease in anxiety. The side effects were tolerable (dry moth and tiredness) then I went to 20mg when I saw a plateau and again it worked even better than 10mg and i saw an overall improvment but now again Im increasing to 30mg so I hope that it will be efffective to take it.

Worked well for that and social anxiety. This drug is a definite killer of one's sex life. After 12 years or so of taking, I decided to try and get off this drug. My 1st attempt was a disaster thanks to my doctor at the time telling me ""just quit taking"", not gradually decrease. Never, ever try it this way. I have since then been fired him. My main advice for those attempting withdrawal is to do so in a gradual, well-managed way. Keep a record as to when you start, how you feel day by day, any unusual occurrences. I started with a 1/2 tab decrease for a week, then 1/4 for another week, and finally 1/4 every other day for the final week. I still can hardly believe I am free of this drug, but I am and my life is much better for it. The key is to slowly step it down. "

I started with the usual 10 mg. Seemed to have good result in first couple of days. Then the usual increase to 20 mg (minimum therapeutic dose) after a week. 10 days after upping the dose I had been doing well but had 3 very 'down' days. Called the Dr., he upped the dose to 40 mg.
Had myriad of side effects at this point, including blurry vision, yawns, increased sexual desire, daytime sleepiness, night time insomnia, among others. Most were fairly mild (I can live on 4-5 hours of sleep if the trade off is feeling this OK) and passed after 2 to 4 weeks at 40 mg. Increased sexual desire is a good thing, I had NONE before. Girlfriend is much happier now.
I have had depression and anxiety my whole life. I had never sought treatment as I felt that I was 'dealing with it' effectively on my own. Boy was I ever wrong. I should have done this 40 years ago. Can't remember EVER feeling this good!
I just hope it lasts because it sounds like getting off of this drug can be very difficult."

I began taking 20mg once per day and it helped but not completely. My doctor upped my dose to 40 mg once per day and it has definitely taken care of my depression and stress issues. When I began taking it I got the shakes a little bit, but that ended after 3 days and I have had no problem since. It is definitely a miracle drug for my problems. 
On a second note, my daughter (26) began taking this for anxiety - 20 mg twice per day. It caused the shakes to start out with which went away, but then her hands, wrists, ankles and lips swelled up. It was the citalopram which caused these problems. So, two different results within our same family. She would probably tell you to stay away from it. I say it works perfectly, but please be careful. First sign of a side effect, call the doctor."

After a few days I felt a calming effect. However, after 1 week I could no longer reach an orgasim & my sleep was horrible. In additon, I was tired much of the time. I have decided to not take anymore anti depressants as most all of them have sexual side effects. I am not that depressed & have managed for 60 yrs. I probably should not have started these meds. I have not met anyone who had anything good to say about these drugs. I do not know anyone who was severely depressed. Can I stop taking my 10 MG all at once or do I have to cut down to 5 MG 1st?

I started feeling much better within a couple of weeks, but it does make it hard to sleep. I was then given another medication for insomnia, but that just made me tired all the time, so now I just try to get along with a little tossing and turning before I can fall asleep most nights.
I've been wanting to get off of my meds for a while now, but it's been a struggle because I've become so dependent on them (as happens a lot with SSRIs like Citalopram, or at least so I've read). I halved my dosage to 10mg about 2 months ago and tried stopping them once, but I just started slipping back into a deep depression.
Citalopram definitely helped me get back the ability to get up in the morning and get things done, but it's a bitch to try to get completely off of it and to feel 100% normal again."

After 3 weeks on the medications I overdosed on both, trying to kill myself. I had to be taken off amitriptyline due to the effects that tricyclic antidepressants will have on my body after my overdose, i was put on 25-75mg trazodone as needed at night, and my citalopram dosage was increased to 60mg daily. So far I have been pretty content on this medication, however I am not sure if that is due to my life changes I have made since the episode. Trazodone is also wonderful for helping me get to sleep. If you are on this medication, DO NOT forget a dose. I forgot a dose one day, met with my therapist later that day and when I got home I was so distraught and upset and couldn't really understand why I was bawling. I also recently started hitting myself when I get upset and I had never done that before I took this medication.

I started on 10mg about four years ago and within the first couple of weeks felt much better.  It worked great for about 8 months, but have had to regularly increase dosage over the last 4 years.  I didn't notice any side-effects until I was up to 40mg.  Then I started experiencing decreased libido and slight weight gain.  I've now been on 60mg (the maximum dosage) for four months and during this time have gained nearly 25 pounds, have no libido, and have horrible acne on my back.  And, the increased dosage hasn't helped my depression or anxiety.  I also was camping in the jungle in Central America and forgot to bring enough Celexa with me.  I was without it for about 4 days and the withdrawal was HORRIBLE.  I was dizzy and confused and my face went numb!  Overall, it worked wonders at first, but now am exploring other options and can't wait to get off of it!  I would not recommend taking more than 40mgs - it had no positive impact on me, and numerous studies I've read have indicated that this is usually the case.  If you're on 40mg and feel like you need to increase your dosage, talk to your doctor about switching meds!

I love it! I was depressed, angry and withdrawn from everyone around me and would bite someones head off without any provocation. I also worried about every little thing. After taking it for a month I started to feel better and mellowed. It's hard to get me angry now and the depression is gone and I don't worry about much of anything. Have gained 10 lbs recently but started working out and lost most of it and feel better too! Weight gain is only an issue if you let it be and choose to sit around and not work out and eat healthy. Can't reach a climax very easily, but solved my pme problem and that's a good side effect for me! There is no shame in taking it, I put it off for too long and regret it now. Life is so much better and everyone can stand to be around me again and I them. I've found I'm actually a fun person since taking this. Just take it! Wake up in the morning, take the pill and forget about it. Only warning I have is, take it everyday! If you don't you and everyone around you will know that your not on it! After a couple days without due to forgetting to take with me on vacation, I was back to my old self in full force. Don't let all the discouraging comments on this site sway you. Try it for a couple months and see what happens, if  you like it keep it, if not then try something else. But you have to give it time, it will not work over night! A month and a week was how long it took for me. Yeah I could feel something after two weeks but really noticed and started getting comments on my attitude after a month. 
612$Condition: Depression$1/7/2011 4:20:13 PM$Reviewer: 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$4$5$This drug makes me feel great mentally!!!  My major side effect is clenching my teeth. When I was upped to 1 and 1/2 pills I broke my tooth and have TMJ syndrome.  Dr. switched me to Lexapro........made me feel horrible mentally.  I'm back on Citalopram but 1 pill now and clenching isn't too bad and feel mentally great again.  I take it around 8pm, sleep like a log and am refreshed upon waking.   Have lost 4 pounds which I didn't need to lose.  I took Zoloft years ago and it made me a zombie and gained 15 pounds on it.  I highly recommend Citalopram but most drugs work differently on each person.  Report your symptoms to your Dr.  Dosage can make the difference.

The first week of taking this medication was very hard for me.  I would take it in the morning, like 7am...And it made me very lethargic and tired.  My mouth became extremely dry and every time I would yawn, it felt like i could faint or like a weird floating feeling...Very strange....But the sexual side effects are great...Increased sexual stamina.

At first it worked well, except for the weight gain.  Now, I am suffering mood swings, which is not the reason I went on this medication.  I spoke with my doctor about the weight gain, because after 16 months on this drug, I had gained 30 pounds.  My doctor said this drug caused weight gain and caused problems with losing it.  With my doctor's approval, I am weaning myself off of this medicine.  He said that withdrawl symptoms can be severe coming off.  I hope it won't be too bad and that I can lose all the weight I have put on.  I also suffered from the headaches and nightsweats.   The drug did work for my anxiety, but the weight gain got to be too much for me.

It began affecting my everyday life.  I was not able to wear jewelry or even go through a car wash.  I began using Lexapro but my insurance company requested to change my prescription to citalopram because it is cheaper.  My physician agreed.  I take 40mg a day.  Without this medicine I would not be able to function normally.  I had hoped to not have to take this medicine all my life.  I tried to stop it on my own but I couldn't take the withdrawls.  If I miss a dose, I feel the affects.  My head feels like it is in the ""twlight zone"" or something.  It is not a good feeling.  I realize a person should not try to stop the medication without the help of a physician.  Taking this medicine has improved my life a great deal.  I was afraid that I would reach a point of not being able to function in society.  I am thankful and continue to take the medicine."

We actually enjoy each other's company now. We're facing foreclosure on our home and I find myself able to handle it without panicking or excessive worry.

Troubles sleeping, tiredness during the day even after a nap, weight gain, diarreha, nausea, very noticeable increase in menstrual cramps, definate increase in sweating, change in appetite. When I first started taking citalopram after that first inital month my anxiety seemed to disappear. That part of the pills is very nice but being a single mother I can not handle being unable to sleep and being so darn tired ALL the time. Then after taking these for several months I have started to feel anxiety again. I take these every day and have not skipped a day. The other day I even had a panic attack. This medication is just not worth it to me. Be aware of ALL side effects when taking something. Also check out if you can take something like ibuprophren or asprin while on the medication trust me you won't want to deal with why. It is NOT fun and can be scary.

I was hesitant about getting on any mood med, but it has helped me tremendously. I am here writing this review... that's the point, I'm here. Diagnosed with major depression at 19, I was prescribed this pill by my family physician after several doctors visits relating to depression and its toll on my mind and body. It took me a while to loose some of the edge of being depressed all the time, but the fact is, I did loose the edge. Not perfection, but hey, no one is perfect. But I know that when I stopped taking this med, I relapsed into another major depressive episode. Went back to the med after 6 months of being utterly miserable all the time, and started improving within months. It takes months, realize, for this particular medicine to show its benefits to the user. Others see results sooner than you will; remember, when you're truly depressed everything is gray. If the roof fell on you you wouldn't care. That's depression. By the time you've realized that you need to see your doctor, make the appointment, actually GO and discuss what you're going through... you have already put your body and mind through so much stress OF COURSE the med won't be an instant cure-all. To the reviewers who've been on this pill for only five days or not long at all, WAIT before submitting your reviews. I am here to testify that without this medicine (the ONLY medicine or supplement I take), I wouldn't have been here today writing this really, really long post. 

Seek help. If this pill doesn't work after six months I would advise you to actively find alternatives with the help of your physician and your physician alone. Not a friend. Not a TV commercial or magazine ad. A real doctor. 

Believe me, you will go crazy (crazier?) trying to piece together all the med jargon you googled online. Hope this helps some one out there in internet land.

The drug seemed to work for the first few months I was on it, but eventually the drawbacks began to outweigh the posities. The drug significantly lowered my libido. It also led to a somewhat unreal feeling of constant happiness and satisfaction.
I eventually felt that the drug wasn't really helping me with my problems. It was covering them up, ineffectively at that.
I found that talking to a therapist was the most effective way to treat my disorder, and I strongly discourage potential users from simply taking a drug to try and cope.
Many doctors are eager to overprescribe drugs and just hope that the problem will go away. It won't. Upping the dosage will not force you to treat the source of these problems.
Personally, while I think that the drug helped me get through a difficult time in my life, I don't think that it's worth losing yourself in the process.
Mental pain, like physical, is indicative that something is wrong. When we treat a physical ailment we don't just treat the symptom; we treat the cause. I feel that anxiety, depression and other emotional illnesses should be looked at in the same manner."

798$Condition: Depression$4/1/2010 1:19:38 AM$Reviewer: crowe27, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$5$5$I have been taking this medicine since March 2008. It is the most effective one I have ever taken for overall depression, mood swings, bad anxiety, and bipolar disorder. It keeps me chilled out so I can relax and be myself, and not panicky and irrational like I can be when it gets bad. Different medicines work for different people, but after Zoloft, Paxil, and Effexor not doing it for me, this was a godsend. I am not advertising for this medicine, this is just what works for me. I recommend to anyone who has any or all of these symptoms to not lose hope and keep an open mind to medicine when therapy isn't enough. If the first or the next rx doesn't work, be patient and keep trying-everyone has a formula that will help make their lives liveable again.

This drug helped me greatly.  No more panic attacks or constant anxiety.  My insomnia also has eased up.

I started immediately seeing the results.  Everyone around me noticed that something was different about me.  It helped my social life tremendously.  I was an exceptionally happy person.  Although, now it seems like I have grown immune to it or something.  I'm overall a happy person, but I no longer feel the need to be social anymore.  The only person I really spend my time with anymore is my boyfriend.  Really, I don't even mind not social, its the weight gain that I don't like. I have gained over 50 pounds since I started taking the medication.  I have diabetes in my family history and it really scares me that I will soon get the disease myself.  I am really starting to think of quiting it, but I do not know for certain yet.  Another thing, that I am not going to go into detail about is my sex life.  This medication has tremendously affected my sex life, in a bad way.  I hope this helps.

Overall, Citalopram is pretty good. I take 20 milligrams each morning but sometimes I feel like I need 30 milligrams in a situation where I feel the onset of an anxiety attack. I've tried to not take it for a day and I find myself feeling extremely nervous, anxious, having feelings of guilt for trivial reasons, and somewhat ""twitchy."" There is a possibility that these are a mixture of withdrawal symptoms and feelings of vulnerability to depression because I know I hadn't taken my medication.  
Another problem I have with Citalopram are the sexual side effects. I feel less sexually driven and an inability to climax on a consistent basis.

A month later I went from a 137ibs to 152ibs so I contacted my doctor he said this medication does not make you gain weight, he said it was my diet. With total weight gain I went from 137ibs to 175ibs. After reading some of the comments at WebMD I found out that this medication DOES make you gain weight. I stopped taking the medicine cold turkey, I am back on my old medication and my weight is starting to come down. After leaving this medication, I had no more bad ideas but sometimes, I cannot control my eyes, they twitch from one side to the other for a second and it happens when im driving. I dont know if it is some kind of withdraw side effect from the medicine and if this is happened to someone else, PLEASE post a comment, I will be checking regularly."

It only took 20 mgs. to raise my B/P.  It usually stays around 110/58 or 112/62.  Now it hovers at 124/76 too high for me.  I have been on it for one day and and twelve hours later, I am trying to get it out of my system.  I cannot take it no more, I left word to the Dr. on his voice mail to go back to Xanax in the morning - .25 mg.  The worst part is that I am not depress - just anxious in my job.  Other effects are Rapid Heartbeat - Headaches - Dizziness - Not able to focus.  Thank goodness I took it one time only!

I guess I don’t like it, as much now that I realize my lack of energy and desire to go outside on a daily basis may be more of a side effect to the drug.  But, I will say no more crying all day, so I guess you have to take the good with the bad.

I stopped worrying but did have side effects once I stopped the xanax that included dry mouth, heavy sweating in arm pits, blurred vision in left eye, tingle sensations in hands and feet, pounding heart beat which would pulse in head as I slept at night, dizziness, lightheaded, and decreased sexual sensation. (could climax just take longer..too long) also felt tired throughout the day even after stopping the xanax so I switched to taking at night which helped. side effects improved or I got used to them and continued taking for 5 months but never really felt like I needed it as I was still having my original problem and once convinced it was not something serious I felt like I could handle things without drugs so I tapered off too 10mg for two weeks then stopped. (doctor wanted me to stay on it until December) On about day 4 of stopping I started feeling severe lightheadedness almost feel kinda drunk and it has not stopped yet (7th day) I have considered taking xanax again until this stops but have not yet (been toughing it out) very scaring feeling wish I never took this drug and just want to feel normal again. I would rather have worry and pain than this. seeing a surgeon next week to hopefully fix hernia and put all my worries behind.

I took it when I got home in the late afternoon.I felt a bit nauseaus, but it was o.k. I also felt shaky and sort of weak.My stomach bubbled with gas, and again, bathroom time.I'm not sure that my symptoms are as bad as the cure, so I'm not sure if I will hang in there to see if it stops. I plan to split my 20 mg pill in half, and just take 10 mg to see if the side effects are lessened. If it's the same, I think I will stop taking this pill.I also don't like getting headaches if I don't take it.

This med. stopped my out of control crying, the angry mood swing and thoughts of ending my life. After about 3-5 wks, myself, family and friends noticed a complete change! Happy again, brain was clear and no bad thoughts.

I call my previous dr and/or ;oca; free clinic // inform them of my situation (and I didnt take NO as an answer) and demand a RX from previous Dr and/or emergency appt at clinic (they charge per your income = I didn't have any money at the time and just had the bill for $20 mailed to me - paid them $2 a month until bill was paid) My doctor informed me that to stop most and/or any  anti-depression meds cold turkey can be and/or is life-threatening

The first three days I had a headache, dry mouth, and my jaw was clenching. It was tolerable. I now feel WONDERFUL! Better than I have in YEARS! I was a complete skeptic plus after reading some of the reviews I was a bit nervous to even start on meds. Well, I'm more energetic. I feel way better about myself no longer just wanting to be alone and cry. No longer feeling like a nervous wreck or having really bad anger. My sex drive has INCREASED! I do have a loss of appetite not too badly though. I still do have a bit of anxiety but citalopram has worked wonders on my depression. I'm still seeing a counselor so I'm sure in time with that it will go work out as well.

I have been on citalopram for two months now and have never felt better.  I am more energetic and that foggy, muddled feeling has gone.  My thoughts are now clear and I can focus on problems and plans without all the effort it used to take.  

I don't know whether or not this drug will have the same effect on you as it does me, but if you are having depression symptoms I have two pieces of advice for you:  1) don't stop trying different medications until you have found the one or ones that works best for you; 2) try citalopram.  "

The panic disorder went away, so did some of the agoraphobia (though sometimes I still feel a little of this), but then I started hearing voices. So I gradually took myself off of it after being on it for a year, and even though the psychotic symptoms got better, they haven't completely quit. This pill makes me feel absolutely horrible. It does almost the exact same thing to me the Prozac did (see my other review), I get horrible jitters, massive confusion, and very sleepy (almost drunk) for days on end. When I'm off it, I feel much better. As far as helping with the Panic Disorder--I'm cured, so it worked rather well for that. Not a good med for schizophrenics (there's a lot of truth to that distasteful joke).

Celexa is a tiny pill and within 1-2 days, i felt the anxiety just melt away,  i could breathe again!!!! its also helping my depression, im more motivated to do things because im less anxious. it made me realize how serious my problem was, a huge contrast. no other side effects except i gained 10lbs but that has stabilized. im more regular, which is good. this is a fantastic drug i highly recommend it.

1135$Condition: Depression$4/29/2009 4:55:52 PM$Reviewer: $3$3$5$Been on this drug for over a year now.  I definitely  feel better than before, however I also changed a lot of things in my life sense.  So, I don't know if it's the medicine or the positive life changes.  I take 20 mg before bed and sleep like a rock but  I feel hungover in the morning & if i get out of bed to quickly I get a major headache... I get a 3-4 day headache at least 1 a month.  Also, very LOW sex drive  I don't mind it but my husband does.  I think it has helped me but I may ask to lower my dosage and eventually stop.

I don't think I would've survived had a compassionate Dr not suggested I start taking an A-D and doing some other things to manage the stress and depression.

I lost my health insurance not long after the marriage ended (unrelated, long story) and tapered myself off (the non-generic Celexa was very expensive.)

Big mistake. Half a decade later and after a number of setbacks and involuntary life changes and financial problems, I was a mess but because things had been happening slowly, I really didn't see it.

Recently and after a case of the shingles, several rounds of cold and flu, and an inner ear infection that took away my equilibrium...

Some family members sat me down and told me they were very concerned that stress and depression were ruining my health and for what might happen to me...

I went to my Dr and got a prescription for the new generic form.

What a difference! Less than a week back onto a 20mg dose and already things are changing for the better!

A-D's are serious drugs and can have serious side effects, if a prescription does not help or generates overtly negative effects, run back to your Dr and change something. I have a family member who had to go through 4 different drugs before the 5th one did the trick"

I posted about 2-3 weeks ago. 
The drug has helped me out a lot. I have been able to read and understand the self help and self improvement books. The side effects are minimal from what I experienced in the beginning. I am tired and I do have more head aches, but they are not bad ones. I have keept to 10mg and have not increased my dose to the full amount of 20. Though I do notice that I get a bit shakey and my eyesight seems a little fuzzy at times. I have started to feel down or cry, but now I am able to think why I am feeling the way I do. I am able to turn my mood around before it gets worse. When I do find my mood is getting worse, I can now reason with myself and look at the brighter side of every situation. It has helped me be more understanding, helped me stop yelling and helped me be more calm. I don't experience the Road Rage and am able to be more in control. Once I feel that my situation is changing or better than it was before. I will consult my doctor on how to get myself off of this, as I don't want it to become  a perminanat crutch for my mental health.
I do have a lower sex drive, but it hasn't gone away.    "

The only downer - when I DO drink, I get tired VERY quickly.  I can usually skip a dose if I want to party! "

The first doctor to prescribe it didn't listen when I told him it wasn't working. My new doctor prescribed me Lexapro which worked wonders but my insurance would not cover it so he gave me Citalopram. He had to increase it from 20 to 40 because it was not working. I have unfortunately gained 30-40 lbs which isn't helping with the whole depression thing. If I miss a dose, my mood swings are worse and I end up crying because I yelled at my little girl. :(

I feel like I haven't found the cure to my real problem.  I cannot physically tolerate any stressful situation.  Citalopram helps treat my symptoms.  When I stopped taking it for a couple of days and I had an animated phone conversation, I felt a lot of chest pressure and pain.  I then took some Lorazepam, as the doctor advised, should this happen.  It was scary, but I am OK.  I am continuing to take the Citalopram.

I have found, though, that different life events moderate the effects of the drug rendering it less effective.  During more stressful times in life, you may find the medications effectiveness drop, but I saw this to be expected.

I did find that the medication made me far less moody and less agitated by ""the little things.""  I am a self-diagnosed obsessive-compulsive and I find it difficult to concentrate in disorganized environments or a room that is in disarray.

One last thing: After being out of country and suddenly running out of the medication (under highly stressful conditions), I experience what I could only describe as a persistent anxiety attack.  I would highly advise patients to ensure they have ample supply when traveling abroad!

Even with my Ambien I have experienced sleep problems. I experienced most all the side effects and have been extremely sick since first I started this medication and my illnesses got worse.  Have been in ER a couple of times with all the symptoms this medicaiton has, but, since I didnt really read the serious side effects I had no clue I personally should not take this medication with other medications I have. A friend suggested today I look at not only serious side effects but drug interactions and after2 1/2 months of ER doctors running all kinds of tests and coming up negative and my doctor treating me for bronchitis but not paying attention to my other complaints I have had the following serious drug interactions as noted under the tab of interactions with other drugs Tell your doctor immediately if any of these rare but very serious side effects occur: stomach pain, fainting, bloody/black/tarry stools, vomit that looks like coffee grounds, easy bruising/bleeding, muscle weakness/cramps, seizures, fast/irregular/pounding heartbeat, difficulty urinating, change in the amount of urine.  I have fainted once in my life years ago...but 2 weeks ago when she increased my dosage a few nights later I fainted...I thought for no reason at all!  I take Lorazepam and Ambien for over 5 years and evidently this drug does NOT interact well for me.  I also have had Vicodin due to the pain from the coughing from the bronchitis along with OTC cough syrups and Theraflu type medications. I HIGHLY suggest you pay much attention to side effects and drug interractions PRIOR to agreeing to take this antidepressant!

I too have had vivid, pleasant dreams, no nightmares.  I have had a significant decrease in libido, but I've actually been able to last longer now with my wife.  I have a great life, wife, kids but always worried about the the 'other shoe dropping' mainly with work.  This drug has taken the edge off, and I feel so much more peaceful, happy now & more comfortable with myself in social situations, more confident. I have not experienced more anger, actually the opposite.  I am only taking 10mg/day in morning (cutting pills in half).  I actually felt WORSE, more jittery, anxious when I was on 20mg (or 10mg of Celexa). I do not feel like I am on a medication. It took alot of courage for me to accept the fact that maybe I needed medical help for my anxiety.  I am not one to normaly take any medical drugs. I tried to work through it, talk with social workers. This drug helps me to take life one day at a time & enjoy it. This medication works for me.

I could always feel my heart beating in my chest so depending on my moods I could feel it pounding or skipping a beat every now and then. I also was very aggrivated by sounds in the evening. If my husband rolled over in bed I would get a shock through my body and get startled and I would be very angry about it. Last night was the first night I took citalopram, I didn't feel my pounding all night and I wasn't startled at all by small sounds throughout the night. I will review again in a month. I hope I don't get all the bad side effects. If this medication helps me after 16 years of extreme anxiety I will put up with any side effects.

I could concentrate, there wasn't a black cloud feeling, I was able to sit and enjoy reading again.  I haven't felt that good in ages.
The following couple of weeks things started to get muddled again.  So I am moving up to 40mg per day as per my doctor.
The other side affects I have had have been stomach aches and sweating especially at night.  But nothing I haven't been able to deal with so far.

I went to the Dr about what I thought where hormonal issues but after blood tests telling all was normal, I was asked if I was depressed.  After breaking down and crying over how awful my life was, I had to agree I could be.  The first few days I did experience a fogginess where it was hard to get words out when people where speaking to me, but now that I have been taking it for a month, I am not so agressive, do not feel so low, my confidence has come back and I can actually go to dinner parties and not feel so exhausted afterwards by having to speak to people.  I do not feel overly tired but I do take it right before I go to bed.

Hang with it for awhile. Everything gets a little better with every day you take it. MOST of the side effects diminished greatly for me after a couple weeks. Seemed like I had 'em all. Nausea, dizziness, forgetfulness, blurred vision, drowsiness, felt spacey, hard time concentrating. Most are pretty much gone, tiredness seems to be the worst but still better than when first started.
 Also for the guys, Dr. said it could cause impotence which it did but only for about a week and went away. Now, it's just a little harder to have an orgasm, but thats ok. Hope this helps you out."

For about 10 years I've been dealing with depression and panic/anxiety order.  For years I tried everything to not have to take meds - stress management class, relaxation therapy, exercise, meditation, you name it.  Finally, I ""gave in"" and decided I couldn't fight on my own anymore.  The first week was pretty awful.  I felt drunk all the time.  Couldn't drive and had a tough time at work.  Then one day, my mind was clear!!!  Seriously clear!  Like I could actually focus.  The sense of being overwhlemed was gone.  It's been about 4 years.  Sometimes I come off it for 2-3 months just to give my boday a break (no one ever told me to do that, I just do.  Each time, the withdrawal is the same as when I first started taking it.  The dizzy drunkness.  It usually takes me just 2 months to remember why I went on it in the first place.  It's an awesome drug.  Doesn't interfere with my life at all.  I still get happy, sad, scared, excited.  I'm just able to focus so much better and take one thing at a time.  I've been married for 5 years now and will be starting a family soon.  I really don't want to have to come off while pregnant or breastfeeding.....

It was not a happy pill..it just cleared the fog.

It helped my depression and anxiety immensely yet their were two side effects I experienced while taking citalopram.  I was tired all of the time and at night had trouble falling asleep.

Overall the bad outweighed the good so I was taken off it, with no luck so far on other drugs (prozac).

Doc told me it would take about three weeks to get into my system but I have been feeling a difference just in two days. Hope it gets better from all the good reviews I have read about this medication. I didn't take the xanax other then when I ONLY felt like I needed one. They were very addicting when I was taking them as prescribed. I was happy to hear that citalopram isn't addicting.  I use to get upset easily and cry when things really got to me, now I have been more relaxed and feel better overall. Im not on edge about things the last couple days and I hope I have the same luck as the other users at dropping a few pounds! Side effects with me has been a little dry mouth and maybe a little tired, but so far so good! Will report later with further comments.

I definitely have seen results for my anxiety and repetitive negative thoughts.  After three weeks I graduated to 15 mg (doctor agreed it was okay to cut pill in half).  The goal is 20mg. I am super sensitive to drugs and wanted to start slow to make sure I could tolerate it.  Side effects included loss of appetite and tight stomach for about 5 days after starting and again as I increased the dose.  I feel like this drug might be just the ticket to control my overactive anxious thoughts.  I am very hopeful.

Quite often, I would work myself into a panic over small things and sometimes over nothing, and my heart would pound rapidly causing my anxiety level to go even higher.  I feel that citalopram has had the effect of keeping my anxiety below the level that would trigger a rapid heartbeat.  The only side effect of any significance I have noticed is that I am often unable to climax during sex.  Other than that it has been incredible helpful.

My wife of 14 years divorced me for a 24 year old kid who worked for us, she was 38.  A friend recommended a psychologist but after the session she said ""you need to see a psychiatrist"".  She recommended one who said ""you're in pretty bad shape, let's see how you do with this drug"".  Well, after less than a week, I was alive again.  I slept well, no dreams, no anxiety attacks, overall happiness (before I felt like wanting to cry all the time) and best of all, sexually I performed like a million.  No ED or premature ejaculation.  I dated a lot of girls in their 20s (I'm 40) and many said they couldn't believe a guy my age could outperform kids their age.  When I told the Doctor I had ED he said the pill could help, but I didn't mention the PE.  It was after a couple of weeks that I noticed how long I was lasting that I looked it up and learned that Citalopram could help eliminate this condition and believe me it did.  This pill truly saved my life.

After not taking this for almost 2 months, I started to feel very tense, jittery, and angry over the slightest thing. Annoyed at everything. I took two tablets, thinking that that would calm me down, and I had a very scary reaction of rapid heartbeat, excessive shaking and the feeling of loosing consciousness.

No major depressive episodes or panic attacks (other than a few caused by other drugs) during this time. If I remember correctly, blurred vision the first week, but virtually no side effects since. Probably decreased libido but hasn't adversely affected that area of my life too much. It says not to drink alcohol, but I've never seen any real interaction while drinking. In all, a great choice, having had bad experiences with Zoloft (flat, 'zombie' mood) then Prozac (fine for a while but then truly horrible side effects when restarting it after a few months off).

I was being treated for both depression and anger and this has helped immensely with both.  I find myself calm, happy, rolling with the punches, and making rational decisions.  I did have sexual side effects (decreased libido, prolonged ""O"") for a while but they went away and that has returned to normal. This is a person I like being, I hope I can feel this way without the drug. "

I suffered from depression, OCD, and anxiety since being a teenager.  After the birth of my daughter a year ago, I suffered from an extreme case of postpartum depression which pushed my current case of mild depression, OCD, and anxiety off the charts.  I finally sought treament last summer and started seeing major changes after 2-3 weeks taking 20mg.  My current dosage is now 60mg daily.  I suffered initally from all the major symtoms including headaches, drowiness, and loss of sex drive.  After 8+ months of using this drug, I only suffer from the loss of sex drive which seems to be getting better as time goes along.  Life is good now and I'm enjoying every moment with my family and friends.  My only regret was not to seek treatment earlier for my problems.

I noticed a difference after a couple of weeks, but after a couple of months I didn't feel I was as happy as I wanted to be. I tried adding Wellbutrin so that I could also quit smoking. The side affects were bad for me and I hadn't cut down on the smoking. I switched to 40mg of Citalopram two weeks ago and it's working amazingly for me. After being depressed for 10 years, I never thought I could actually be this happy. If this drug doesn't work for you, don't give up, there is something that will work for you. It might take a long time to find the right drug and dosage, but it's well worth it in the end. I'm glad I finally got help.

Although it hasn't taken the depression and anxiety totally away (it's not a happy pill) I feel motivated and can actually push the down feelings away and focus on something else. My depression isn't absorbing my life anymore, and I can function like I used to. I only wish that I would feel totally normal with no down thoughts, but I think therapy will help that go away. I have had no side effects except for yawning and tiredness a few hours after I take it, which helps me go to sleep, and this way I don't need a sleep drug for insomnia. I feel a little of the decreased sex drive, but that is a small price to pay for leading a normal life.

The 3rd day was fabulous - no headaches or nausea... I was in the best mood of my life. The 4th day was pretty good too, but every day after has been fairly blah. I suppose my disposition has improved a bit, but I'm still dealing with the non-hunger and I have lost 7 pounds because I can only manage to eat an orange or a yogurt every day. My hair has been falling out like it did after I gave birth. It definitely increased suicidal thoughts when dealing with a terrible break up two days before Xmas (though I had the presence of mind to have friends stay with me and not be alone), but it has helped me deal with everything better thus far. I'm going to take it for another month and see how things go. I'll let you know if anything changes.

I have been sick to my stomach and hardly able to eat also. I slept GREAT the first night, but only managed to get 1 hour of sleep last night - will try taking it in the morning to see if that helps. The other strange thing is that I am a very busy, rapid thinking person and if you picture all the trains of thought you have at once (which is typically 7) as lanes on a highway, I feel like 5 lanes have been blocked off and traffic is trickling through. Does anyone know how long the headache and nausea are supposed to last? I will post again as progress continues and side effects taper off.

On this one, I have relatively few.  I have gained about 5 pounds, but that is okay because I do not weigh very much.  It has helped with my depression, but I still feel anxious a lot, but that is probably mostly a logical reaction to life changes.  The problem is that I get very moody if I forget to take this medication, which I often do.  I then usually remember a few hours later and take it and start feeling fine soon after.  I have even experienced a panic attack because I forgot to take my dose of citalopram one day.  Also, I have been having worse nightmares than normal since getting on this, that bother me more than they used to.  Otherwise, this seems to be a good drug for me with few side effects, and hardly any physical side effects (no sexual problems unlike with Paxil :D )

I switched to Citalopram from Lexapro, which worked great aside from side effects in the first 2 months. Lexapro was unfortunately not covered by insurance, which was why I switched. I was on Citalopram for nearly a year, but it was not as effective as Lexapro had been. My mood was much more variable - good on some days, but terrible on others. In addition, I gained 20 lbs on this medication because it increased my appetite and caused me to crave carbohydrates.

After an MRI and spinal tap other tests to rule out multiple sclerosis (I seriously had 95% of the symptoms of MS) and a week in the hospital, I stopped taking this medication. The side effects completely stopped after about a month and a half and that was when I associated the 2.

1573$Condition: Depression$10/18/2007 3:17:31 PM$Reviewer: 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$4$5$Prior to taking this medication I was experiencing severe depression symptoms--crying, loss of appetite, anxiety, sleep problems.  Once the medication was started and a therapeutic level was determined, my mood improved, appetite improved, anxiety symptoms decreased and rarely occur.  This medication has been very effective for me.

I was just okay.  Most of my family is on Prozac for depression.  I would like a medication to make me feel better 80% of the time and not feel just okay for 65% of the time.  There was at the start a stomach issue; where I felt that I was going to throw up and then it disappeared just as quickly as it came.  Through the course it did subside.  I feel it is a good standard medication, but I think I need a little more of a boost.  I know there will be down days and that is expected, but I feel I want a little more zip.

The side effects were extreme—either not enough sleep or I’d sleep the entire day, always felt unwell and nauseous, horrible headaches.

Previously, I had taken Zoloft for many years.  The Zoloft began giving me severe heartburn, so I had to stop taking it.  Celexa controls my clinical depression.  Without the medication, I am angry and unable to interact with others without being abrupt and hurtful.  I really like that it doesnâ??t take a great length of time to get back into your system if you are without it for a few days.  I am pleased with this medication as it allows me to function in my daily life.

Before starting treatment with this medication I was riddled with anxiety and would pretty much only leave my house to go to work and worried constantly that I would have a panic attack in front of people or I would be inside a place like a grocery store and have to leave due to the stress of it all. Sometimes I couldn’t even get out of my car to go inside. Since I have been taking Celexa, my symptoms are definitely lessened. It’s a work in progress but Celexa is definitely helping. As far as side effects, I’ve only had one negative and that is a complete loss of interest in physical intimacy.

The first week or so on it was horrible with all the side effects (dry mouth, night sweats, headache), but I stuck it out and am really glad I did. I recently increased to a 20mg dose because I was still experiencing quite a bit of anxiety w/the smaller dose. Some depression meds make you drowsy/spacey but Celexa hasnâ??t made me that way at all. I highly recommend giving it a try!

I refused to take any SSRI despite my Doctors recommendation. It took her 6 months to get me to try one as I was petrified of any drugs that alter the mind. Eventually I had no choice , I became extremely mentally sick and because of this physically. I lost 30 pounds in 5 months. I tried celexa 10 mg along with clornazapan and never looked back. I had no side effects outside drowsiness which was fine I then took it before bed and finally I was able to sleep. I gained my appetite back and I never felt more clarity and happiness. This little pill saved my life. My only regret was I never took it sooner as my doctor adviced. Celexa is a life changer. I highly recommend it.

I have increased from 20 mg to 40 mg about 6 years ago. My pregnancy had no effects from this medication. It keeps me from panic attacks, anxiety & depression without making me feel ""fake"" happy-as I did with Lexapro. The only downside is when I forget to pick up my prescription. Stopping this med cold turkey is NOT something that should be done. I have had bouts of severe vomiting, and targeted shooting pains in my head, as well as prolonged nausea & heartburn after not taking it for 2+ days. Talk to your doctor before stopping this med!"

I had taken Celexa before as a teenager when dealing with anxiety, at that time it worked well for me but I got pregnant and stopped taking it since, that was 8 years ago. My doctor prescribed me to Celexa again and after about a month I started noticing that I was feeling so much better. I could drive without much anxiety at all. I wasn't shaking or feeling I was on the verge of an attack. I never realized how much anxiety was taking over my life. The only side effect is pretty bad dry mouth.

I took this pill for Severe post-partum anxiety/OCD. I stayed on it for 17 months. And it was truly the worst 17 months of my life. The worst intrusive thoughts I have ever experienced, felt like I was in a constant panic attack 24/7 where I literally felt like I was going insane, my thoughts were constant loops of irrational fears and I would do anything to try and make them stop, I thought I had something spiritually wrong with me or I was going insane, horrible derealization, lost connection with almost every person except my boyfriend, no connection with my baby, couldn't feel any of my body whatsoever except barely my feet and the back of my back, lost all faith in God, wanted to commit suicide many times. I stayed on this medication for 17 months because I thought this was just how i had ""become"" from having a baby. The doctors said it was just anxiety and they didn't want to take me off of it to ""destabilize"" me. I was afraid I would only get worse without it. It finally became too much and I told them to take me off it and put me on Prozac for OCD. I am finally weaned off after a week, day 2 without it and day 2 of a full dose of Prozac. The intensity of my thoughts have lowered and I am starting to feel my head and legs again. I wouldn't wish what I went through on my worst enemy. Celexa was a living hell for me. I hope I keep getting better."

I felt so good on Celexa that I continued to use it for 11 years.  I use it through two pregnancies.  Now, I have been off of it for about 45 days.  While on Celexa, I felt fine and things did not bother me much.  My babies, when born, did not cry.  They were the calmest children while breastfed.  Now I wonder what have I done.  I am physical sick every day.  I can not do simple tasks like go grocery shopping or listen to an automated recording on the phone. The migraines are intense and nausea excruciating, irritating, and my overall feeling miserable.  Do Not Take This Drug!  If you are on it, it is time to talk to your doctor about something different.  Take my advice, the shorter the half life of the drug, the better.

I've tried taking Wellbutrin, but had felt worse. I was sensitive to everything.. ""Light, Sound"" Everything bothered me. That's when went back to my DR., Wrote a list of all of my symptoms and He prescribed me Celexa. As of now, I don't feel numb. I do however feel neutral. I'm not consumed with Depression.., Feeling sad, or hopeless. For the first time, in a long.., long time.. I feel content. I haven't lashed out or snapped at anyone. I haven't had any recent panic attacks. The only downside that I can see and that's feeling tired all the time and a little itchy and a lack of concentration, but the pros outweigh the cons.. "

I gained 40 pounds, and my metabolism was essentially ruined. My anxiety worsened significantly, and my depression stayed about the same. I slept constantly, and felt like I was in a mental daze, which disappeared almost immediately after the drug had completely left my system. Once moved on to another SSRI, the bulk of my symptoms dissipated.

I had began working a second job part-time in November of 2015. I had no other option as doctor bills began piling up, so when I started experiencing tightness in my chest and a slight feeling of breathlessness, I went to my doctor. High blood pressure runs in my family, as well as anxiety and this medication has helped me tremendously. For the first 3 weeks I felt more tired than normal, but afterwards that wore off and I have lost about 7 lbs. Things I use to stress about, I don't get so out of sorts about anymore. I feel balanced and in control. I don't intend on staying on this medication forever, but right now, it has been exactly what I needed.

I was in counseling and it was helping but I was tired of crying all the time and so much mood swings. My body couldn't handle all that I was going through and finally my ""little ball of sunshine"" outlook went with it. Now that I have been on them so long I feel happy and I can smile again.

Anxiety attacks are very rare and I almost never cry (this used to be a big problem).

I work full time and take 6-9 credit hours/semester while raising two children. Surprisingly I was diagnosed with depression. I started with 10 mg of Celexa. My mood improved tremendously within the first two weeks. I had zero side effects. I don't feel numb to emotion, in fact I feel like I have better control over my emotions. Everyday stresses bothered me less. Overall I am very pleased with this drug. The only downside for me is that it does not interact well with alcohol. I like to drink socially and can usually hold my liquor very well but, since being on this drug, I blackout easily which never happened to me before. I have be very careful not to overdo it.

After discussing the problems I was dealing with, my doctor prescribed 10mg of citalopram for me with instructions for a return consult in a couple weeks. I felt a little sedated at first but also much more at ease and less depressed. Wife quickly noticed the difference in my demeanor as well and now makes sure that I take the medication on schedule. I had some minor GI upset initially which dissipated. The only other problem with taking the drug was when my doctor increased the dose to 20mg, which caused some sexual difficulties. After contacting my doctor, I was instructed to reduce the dose back to 10mg a day or two before sex might be expected and then back to the 20mg dosage afterwards. I know, this disrupts spontaneity but the overall tradeoff is well worth it for both me and my wife. We're both very happy with the results of the drug.

I have now been on celexa (citalopram 20 mg) for a little over a month and I haven't experienced any negative side effects other than drowsiness after taking the medication. I take it before going to sleep at night so that it does not affect my daily routine. It wasn't until about the 4th week that I began to notice that my anxiety had decreased significantly. I used to become completely overcome with anxiety and worrying almost daily and I have now gone an entire week without becoming anxious at all. I do still experience anxious thoughts on occasion but I am now able to redirect my thinking and let them go rather than obsessively focusing on them and becoming depressed. I have never reviewed anything like this before but as there are so many bad reviews out there I thought it was important to let people know that my experience has been nothing but positive.

After increasing dosage a few times when it started fading in effects, I'm now on 30mg and will probably move up again in a few months. It's helped me have a good outlook and not be so depressed, but therapy is also necessary for most people with underlying issues.

I take 40 mg every night right before bed and it has helped control my anxiety and depression. I have had anxiety and depression and have been medicated for as long as I can remember. Celexa has been the best medicine for me so far and I have been on plenty of other anxiety and depression medicines. I notice when something begins to upset me or stresses me out, I become slightly dizzy and it feels a little like I'm having an out of body experience to the slightest degree. The feeling and dizziness fade quickly once I'm able to calm down. It's nothing horrible and it doesn't bother me much because the good effects from this medicine outweigh this side effect. I don't have the ""numb"" feeling that everybody talks about. I still feel happy, sad, and angry like I should. I'm just able to get through my days without the crippling effects of anxiety and depression. It was a little hard for me the first few weeks because I was convinced it wasn't working and I felt like my anxiety was actually increasing. But I stuck with it faithfully and at about 6 weeks, I started to feel pretty good. I stopped having so many anxiety episodes during the day and I noticed I was a slightly bit more optimistic about life. I knew it was FINALLY starting to help and it has continually helped me more and more the longer I have stuck with it. I know Celexa isn't for everybody but it's been a literal life saver for me and I'm pleased with the mental progress I've been able to make since being on it. "

My sex drive isn't as high as it used to be, I have almost no appetite (I only eat because I know I'm supposed to, and hypoglycemia contributes to panic episodes), and I have occasional nausea that goes away quickly, but these side effects are 100% worth it.

I was prescribed Celexa due to Obsessive thinking, social anxiety, and mild depression. I have previously taken Prozac and Lexapro but wasn't too happy with them due to feeling detached and more of a ""zombie"". Celexa was the first medication I have ever taken that made me feel ""normal"" in that I didn't think my personality was being altered to any significant degree. I started at 20mg and gradually worked up to 30mg over the course of 4 months due to persistent social anxiety. Now, roughly 6 months after starting Celexa, I think it's time for ween myself off. One of the biggest issue I had was sexual dysfunction. I literally had no desire to have sex, nor did it pop into my mind. I knew if someone was attractive and that I should be feeling some type of arousal, but that never happened. Another HUGE issue for me is that whenever I get anxious I sweat ALOT. Some research and speaking to my MD helped me understand that SSRI's can affect ones temperature sensitivity. So i was getting anxious about sweating when the very thing that was supposed to make me not anxious caused me to sweat in the first place...go figure. I recently forgot to take Celexa for roughly 3 days and felt so much better (even though I knew withdrawal was bound to happen). Now i'm just taking 20mg a day and so far I am experiencing some confusion/detachment from reality."

He also gave me a small  I MADE THE MISTAKE OF RESEARCHING ALL OF THE POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS!!!! I completely understand researching a drug before you take it- but it is important to remember that a lot of people who have positive experiences most often do not write about it. It is the people who have negative experiences who will. I was PETRIFIED to take the drug b/c of the horror stories, until one day I realized that the side effects of the pill were worth it if it meant that I could have peaceful days. I took the first 10mg at night and had (and continue to have) a FANTASTIC sleep. I did not experience ANY nausea, no tightness of chest, no insomnia, no panic, no anxiety, NOTHING but a slight headache. It felt as though the pill gave me relief almost immediately. I have been on the pills for a little over two weeks. They have been a lifesaver for me!! I feel at peace. The racing, flooding thoughts have stopped. The panic attacks have been nonexistent.

The first two months I had a lot of nausea always about 1 hour after taking celexa, however, it worked amazing to relieve my anxiety and depression. For the first time in years, I was able to relax and was happy. After the second month though, I just began to feel numb. I didn't care about anything. Things that used to upset me no longer did, but things that used to make me smile didn't affect me either. But my depression prior was severe, so I stayed on it and focused on learning about myself and how unreasonable it is to feel unnecessary anxiety leading to depression. And things were better.

The reason I stopped taking celexa is because it caused SEVERE MEMORY LOSS. It started small. I couldn't remember what happened yesterday. Then, after month two, I couldn't remember conversations people would tell me I had with them. And at the end of month three, I was standing in front of a desk somewhere  (I don't even remember where I was) with a woman in front of me asking me what my name was. I stared blankly at her. I couldn't remember. I apologized and had to pull out my wallet and look at my drivers license to remember my middle name.

But on a positive note, it  feels back to normal now (about 1 year later) I apologized to my friends and let them know what I was going through, and surprisingly, one of my friends who I've known to have memory problems told me that he was taking the same medication.

At first it took away my anxiety and then made me sleepy a lot. After 6 or so weeks i wasn't sleepy all the time, the anxiety was gone and my depression diminished significantly. It seems to put a floor on how low I get. I love this medication for giving me another chance. I wish I had taken it a long time ago.

First months of taking it I had no appetite whatsoever and lost a lot of weight.  Yes, it helps with depression, but if you miss one or two doses, everything becomes awful.  Also, getting sleep with it is next to impossible.

I spent the first 6 years on 40 mg, then cut it down to 20mg, and now am on just 10mg.  I needed it years ago because I was living in a very chaotic situation and was having panic attacks, crying jags at work, not being able to tolerate any stress, etc.  This medication has really helped me.  It takes about a month for the body to adjust to this medication.  I've tried Zoloft and Paxil, but they made me gain weight and I had alot of tiredness.  I also tried amitryptalene which was awful - I gained weight immediately.  Celexa has been nothing short of a miracle.  One of the side effects I experienced were some night sweats - though, they could be due to my bad periods.  The other side effect that never went away was a very low sex drive and a feeling of being non-emotional - not really ever crying or feeling ecstatically  happy - just the same all the time.  This was totally fine, but eventually, as my job and living situation got more secure, I didn't need as much of the dose.  That is why I have slowly decreased my dose to 10mg.  Though a small amount of anxiety has come back, so has the sex drive so that is good.  The celexa helps me to feel in great spirits, calm and collected under stress, and peaceful. It also helped with severe PMS which is a bonus.  Everyone's body is different, but for me, this has been a great drug.

1681$Condition: Panic Disorder$1/6/2015 6:51:39 AM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$4$4$"This medication works great for me. Sometimes there is a little anxiety that will come up but NOTHING like what I used to experience with constant panic attacks out of nowhere. No pill can help with all of it. Only reason it is 4/5 for ease of use is you need to remember to take it everyday, with any type of pill, which sucks sometimes. Overall it really helped and I have been on it almost 3 years now no side effects. Half the time people have low sex drive, weight gain, etc it really is other reasons but everyone is quick to blame a medication, and ""suddenly"" feels better when they stop (mind over matter... placebo effect). Give it a try, have good expectations, and give it at least a month to work. Just because you feel anxious the first day you have it and have a ""heart attack"" (panic attack) its because it hasnt started working yet and you are still experiencing your anxiety!! Give it a chance :)"

I'm taking it for social anxiety. I couldn't stand being around a lot of people without thinking there looking or Judi g me constantly. I always wanted to run away from social situation. 

Anyway I started at 10mg for first two weeks the first few days felt like I had a lot of energy and jitteriness. After that I had extreme anxiety sweating insomnia jaw clenching. After two weeks moved to 20 mg again extreme anxiety bad thoughts ect. This lasted right up to week 5 on the drug. Now let me tell you I feel amazing no more anxiety nothing I feel great. I will be sticking to 20 mg until I feel the need to higher the dose. There is one side effect that has stuck with me still, it is much harder to orgasm, I'm not saying it killed my sex drive because it hasn't it just takes awhile to orgasm. I've also lost weight so far as my appetite has decreased.

Please read do not go online looking up a ton of reviews it will scare you from taking it. If you need just try and stick it out the first month WHICH IS HORRIBLE but once it kicks in it is great. If you do decide to read reviews make sure it's reviews from people that took it atleast 2 months because again the first month is hell for me anyway. Put it this way I can see myself on this for the rest of my life and I'm not even 30 yet. Hope this helps someone out there by the way I'm on the generic citalopram much cheaper"

felt so much better after being on this med for a while I decided to wean myself off it..bad move as I experienced such a bad relapse of severe depression, I thought I would never feel better again.  I went back on this med and finally 6 mos later I am feeling better again.  Be careful about going off your meds without doc supervision, it was a lot harder for me to feel better after relapse.

That constant ""under-current"" of negative and fearful energy completely went away after 10 days to 2 weeks of using it. My manic episodes lasts a few days, instead of a week and are less dramatic.  The side effects are still there... constant drowsiness and diminished ability to reach orgasm.  But the benefits well outweigh the negatives. "

Been in therapy through the years and tried many different medications. I have been taking 20mg Celexa for about 5 months now and I feel better than I can ever remember feeling. I did have constant yawning for the first month, and still do periodically. I take it at night and sleep better than I have in years. Yay for that! I have noticed that I don't feel deeply on this medication (like watching a sad movie where I would normally cry, I don't). It definitely takes the edge off and keeps my mood at a manageable level so I can deal with the difficulties life throws at me. Another thing I would suggest is something called Mindfullness Training. I am also doing that through the Veterans Administration and it is extremely helpful with interpersonal communications with family, friends, kids, and work relationships.

Some years ago, I took Paxil, and it gave me the worst stomach pain and temporary restless leg syndrome, which was the most bizarre experience.  I was afraid to try another anti-depressant after my past experience, but I couldn't get out of the hole I was in, which just kept getting deeper and deeper.  It was to the point where when Robin Williams ended his life, I kept wishing it were me instead.  I went to my doctor because I had been battling sickness after sickness (strep throat, cold, flu, etc.) for several months, and told her about the funk I was in.  She told me that depression actually suppresses one's immune system, which would explain why I kept getting sick, so she prescribed Celexa, stating it may help to bring me out of the depths I had been in for so long.  I was hesitant.  I resisted for a couple of weeks.  But after the worst bout of crying and suicidal thoughts I'd had since this started, I decided to take half a pill (5mg).  I had a headache the next day, but not terrible.  Took another 5mg the next day, then upped it to the prescribed dose of 10mg.  I've been taking it for two weeks, and let me tell you, I haven't felt this ""normal"" in months... maybe years.  I have the occasional bout of nausea, but not terrible, and a headache every so often, but save that, it's been a miracle.  I don't plan on being on them forever, just until I feel like I can handle life on my own again.  However, I would recommend them to anyone who is suffering from what feels like Hell on Earth.  They work.  They work fast.  I can smile.  I can laugh.  I don't feel nervous or terribly sad.  I feel like me.  And that feels so good.  "

I have taken a few medicines for my depression and none of them have given me side effects like this.

If you accidentally run out of this medication IT IS DANGEROUS! They claim it stays in your system for weeks  so there is supposed to be no worry if you run out but that is a crock. I ran out of it for 5 days and ended up having to go beg the   doctor to see me early. I did not feel like myself, my blood pressure was 147/103 (and I have never had high blood pressure). And I was flipping out. Not a good feeling. So all in all it does help, but only for a little while.

I began taking it for general anxiety/depression.  It is amazing.  I have never felt better.  It has quieted my mind, took away the anxiety and negative self-talk that owned me for so long, and has made me more confident and focused than ever before.

The first night I took it, I felt an immediate difference the next day.  I felt a sense of calm and my mind was quiet.  After about a week, my wife noticed a total difference in me.  After the next few months, it just got better and better.  

I have had no serious side effects as others have mentioned.  The only thing I have noticed is that I am a bit more sensitive to alcohol.  That's not a big deal to me though at all.  I had slightly more vivid dreams for a couple of months but that went away.  

I have always taken it at night based on the doctor's recommendation and have had no issues.

Give it time.  My doctor said it takes a few months to fully feel the full effects.  She is absolutely right based on my experience.  It's an awesome drug.  Give it a chance if you feel you may need it, it might change your life.  I am a better husband and father for it."

Recently, there have been a lot of changes in my life and my doctor felt like it was time to try something new.  I was put on Celexa 40 mg.  I read the side effects when I first got the medicine (something I don't normally do).  I laughed at the fact that this medication could cause constipation.  Not only have I been depressed, but I have been constipated for about half of my life.  Although I was unsure about this particular side effect, I decided that it was better to be out of my black hole.  This is my fifth day on Celexa.  I have experienced nausea, sleep deprivation and headaches.  The nausea subsided after a few days.  My only concern is that I woke up this morning and couldn't see clearly.  I felt a film over my vision and couldn't even spuint to see better.  I looked up side effects once again and did not see blurred vision as a side effect.  I am hoping that as the day goes on, things will become clearer.  Over all, this medication seems to be working.  We shall see.  "

My only question now is that the last 2 days I am having quick little flashes of headache---like just seconds, and I do not know if it is related to Celexa or not yet, could possibly be allergies, as everything is dusty outside right now. It happens a few times a day, often right behind one eye or over it. I do not usually get headaches. It has given me energy to do my work now, and I am sleeping great so far, so hope this headache thing is something that will do away in time. Good the headaches never lasts long.

1758$Condition: Depression$1/16/2014 11:57:29 AM$Reviewer: Katherine, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$5$4$I have been taking Celexa for 7 years due to depression and anxiety. I started with 20 mg and eventually went to 60 mg which seemed to work for me. My doctor recently changed my dosage to 40 mg due to new studies that have found anything over 40 mg can cause heart issues and/or death (great). Celexa has helped me with my depression/anxiety and even OCD. I used to take it along with Wellbutin, and stopped Wellbutrin when I went up to 60 mg of Celexa. But now that I am back down to 40 mg, I am back on Wellbutrin. Only negtive side effect I had from Celexa the first couple of months I took it was extreme sleepiness to the point I would fall asleep at my desk at work even though I was getting 8 hours of sleep at night. After a few months, that side effect disappeared. Weight gain was about 10 lb total over the last 7 years, no big deal. I was anyway from the depression, so that was a good thing. Not even sure if the weight gain is due to Celexa. I would recommend Celexa as a way of taking the edge off depression and anxiety, you just need to make sure you find the right dosage amount for you. It has done a world of good for me!

It took a solid 6 weeks for it to kick in, and a few months for the worst of the side effects to wear off (sweats, vivid dreams, disconnected feelings, digestion issues). After that it just seemed to keep getting better. My everyday anxiety and occasional panic attacks became very muted, and much easier to manage. This helped me stop depending on benzos for anxious ""flare ups."" Everyone around me noticed and my relationships improved. I lack the extremes in emotions, for better or worse. In the beginning, I wasn't noticing the weight gain. I actually felt like I was making better dietary choices. But I was a little more tired and I now require at least 8 hours of sleep a night or I need a nap during the day (less energy/activity). I also didn't notice the gradual decline in my sex drive. So, now that I am at about a year of taking this RX, I realize that while my anxiety and panic are managed--staving off the depression that they caused--the 20-25lbs I've steadily gained, coupled with the low sex drive is negatively affecting me, and my partner! So, I'm looking to change meds at this point. Again. I've previously taken buspirone (Buspar), and paroxetine (Paxil). Neither were as effective as citalopram."

After this first month I have noticed no lessening of any of my depression symptoms. I had noticed a worsening if anything in the last two weeks but am unsure if this is related to the medication. What surprised me the most was for the last two weeks I have ended my sleep cycles on a horrible note. Vivid dreams of a negative sort forcing me to awake with a truly awful anxiety. I had no idea this could be caused by early use of this medication until reading here what other users had experienced, All cases I've read state this does not last so fingers crossed this side effect dissappears sooner rather than later. 

I have noticed no effect on my appetite or sex drive.

Will keep posted. I hope one finds this somewhat helpful. Cheers."

Nothing worked. Before Celexa I was on Lexapro, which is supposedly the newer, more 'refined' version of Celexa, and felt horrible. About 6 months ago, I decided to switch over to Celexa and have never felt better. I felt a difference right away (within a day or two). I am finally back to my happy, bubbly, chatty self. Other SSRIs that cut my anxiety made me feel 'flat'. Not Celexa. On Celexa I'm still able to feel my emotions-I can laugh and cry (when appropriate)-without feeling overwhelmed by them. I take it in the morning and have so much energy all day. I highly recommend this medication.

So I just started taking this drug (20mg every morning) about a week ago. My whole life I've never really felt something this bad... I've always noticed that when I get something in my head I have to get ""approval"" so I don't need to worry..but I also am a huge perfectionist. Any time I'm sick or think something may be wrong with me, straight to the doc for this guy gotta have that answer now! I just graduated college and just took on an awesome (very stressful) job. Someone at work mentioned that one of our workers who went out off on his own as a salesman killed himself because of stress... my OCD hit overload on that one. Since then, I had convinced my self I was crazy. Every little thing wrong in my life or that I have done in the past, if it comes in my head, I get hooked! Although this has been awful.. I have struggled with alcohol and some depression for a while and found this as a possible Godsend to change my life and let go of alcohol and my worrying. To sum things up.. just was wondering if anyone else has felt this way. Whenever I think of one bad thing about myself it becomes ""wow..that's whats really wrong with me huh?"" Only been a few days but praying for the best! Thanks in advance to anyone who replies. "

I saw things that were not there...I was taken to the hospital - put my loved ones though h---They didn't know where I was until the police notified them.

The second day on it, I started having some very strange side effects. I first noticed that my pupils were incredibly dilated, as though I was on a heavy drug. I shrugged this off and began to watch television. I have some hearing issues, and typically turn on subtitles. I then noticed that I could hear perfectly fine! I was pretty excited about this... Until I started feeling like I was melting into the couch. Then I looked down at my phone and it was one giant blur. Everything was moving all over the screen.

It makes you extremely hungry, but despite watching and eating healthy, it refuses to come off. And this was after I had lost 40 pounds on my own! 

Despite the increased appetite, I should mention that I have no libido with this as well. Nothing, I can't even get in the mood and when I manage to, it physically hurts. 

I also feel like a walking zombie, as I'm just ""here"" and that's it. I feel constantly tired and despite 30MG of adderall, it's still there. I don't feel like myself, even though the depression is better, but at the same time, it feels like I don't care and it's not worth it.

I can't even muster the energy to get angry, and I'm constantly tired or yawning.

I have already tried Wellbutrin and it made me all over the place with my moods. Doctor ended up switching me to Celexa, which hasn't been good for me either. Doctor sent me home with a trial of Viibryd and to see how that does after I wean myself off of Celexa. I am hoping for better results for sure."

Lexapro made me soooo tired.  I gained weight and didn't want to do anything.  Lethargic.  At first it worked great but quickly went to laying around all the time and not feeling motivated.  It's hard to get adjusted to and takes time.  Give yourself time and be patient. It did have some sexual sides effects but when my doctor put me on Wellbutrin it offset that side effect and I was back to having orgasms but I couldnt take the weight gain and tired feeling.  I am on Celexa now and its works GREAT for anxiety and I've lost the weight! But I am having some sexual side effects.  I think it also hinders my sleep a little bit.  I notice sometimes more anxiety but not giving up. This stuff works great for day to day living.  I will be patient and give it some more time.  For now this is working.

My doctor told me it's in the same class as the Prozac, which my daughter takes and does fine, no side effects at all. It just goes to show that different drugs affect people differently.

My snap anger was diminished (if not gone), the everyday irritations became tolerable, and I found happiness in day-to-day life again. 12 days later I bumped up to 40mg as the doctor had recommended after a few bouts of mild irritability that seemed to remain. Side-effects for me are very mild. I do have to take in the morning so that it does not keep me awake, other than that all else seems fine. I wish everyone luck in their struggles. I hope that you each find the inner peace that you deserve. "

Went from a healthy, active, full of energy human to best describe is a vegatative state. Slept 12 to 18 hours per day and was always exhausted. Didn't care about living, no hope of the future, absolutely zero energy. Major increase in the frequency of the panic attacks, so severe that I ended up in the hospital E/R. Had chest pains daily, tingling in both hands, muscle spasms in my legs and feet. B/P at the E/R was 212/100. My quality of living did not exist on the scale. I just wanted to die and get it over with. Even visited my children and was saying my good-bye's.  I decided to stop cold turkey against my Dr's advice.  I had nothing left to live for and confusion and lack of energy left me hopeless, I WANTED to DIE.  After being off the medication for a few days, I started feeling better. Now it has been a month and I have returned to being alive again. 8 hours of sleep and I am full of energy and excited to be active all day without getting tired and exhausted. Going to work now is refreshing compared to struggling on how to drive there safely without getting lost on the way.  I highly recommend the FDA reconsider the safety aspect of this drug.  I can't imagine how many people are taking this medicine and not able to think clearly or go into a very deep depression as I did.  I wish my Dr. would take this medication for a month and report their mental/mood changes and desire to live.  If they did, I believe they would reconsider prescribing this potentially life threatening drug. I will update this post after 6 months without Celexa, but for now I recommend that this drug be banned for human consumption.

The first 5-6 Years were just great upon this Medication in many ways. I felt like THIS Script was the first out of the many, MANY different SSRI's & such that I've been Prescribed was actually going to help Myself  out lots. Well, as I said..it did. But then came sometime in 2010. For whatever reason, (Notice, also about 4 Years in, My 40mg dose got knocked up to a daily 60mg dose) it just stopped having an effect on Me at all...You know, whatsoever. As I said, THAT was back in 2010, (Early 2010, maybe) when it lost its Potency, and I have STILL been taking it. Scared of the awful SSRI Discontinuation withdrawals that could possibly manifest You know...I've been taking it now basically 7 Years. But as I said, the other Medication that I have mentioned in this post, 100% definitely helps out, so I don't see the problem in continuing to take it, as other than the fact I feel its lost a lot of it's potency, there are also not a single Extrapyramidal symptom tht I get from it. So I'm Thankful for that. I WOULD recommend Celexa to first time SSRI users as I said, it worked great for Myself for many Years, and I never had Sexual Impotence, or any usual effects the the SS Reuptake Inhibitors are known to cause. I, Myself would say this is THE best SSRI, and I've taken at least 12 of them. "

Prior to hospitalization, I was taking Wellbutrin 150mg twice daily. The Celexa has helped immensely with my mood, and it took me only 4 days to start noticing a major difference in how I feel about myself.

I used to not even get out of bed. I also seem to handle stressful situations with less anxiety. I have been able to enjoy a few of my old hobbies again. For the first time in over a year, I can see a light at the end of the tunnel. The only side effect I'm experiencing IS LITTLE TO NO INTREST IN SEX. I also have an EXTREMELY hard time achieving orgasm now, and if I am lucky enough to have one, the intensity level is about 2/10, where as before I starting taking this medication, I had a very high sex drive, and no trouble having multiple orgasms with an intensity level of 8-9/10. I am a 37 year old female, in a stable and supportive relationship with a man, and this has been a MAJOR issue with me, since we used to enjoy sex at least twice a day. I know it seems silly to regard sex as being so important. I have a wonderful emotional connection with my partner, but now I am unable to connect with him physically. I plan to talk with my therapist about a possible med change if there is no way to fix the current situation. Other than this one single complaint,(which many people probably wouldn't object to) THIS MEDICATION HAS TRULY WORKED WONDERS, AND I FEEL HOPEFUL ABOUT LIFE AGAIN!!!

On 10mg day for about a month, so far so good. Side effects have been tolerable. Most noticeable was the nausea and loss of appetite for 1st 2 weeks. Have lost about 5 pounds, cravings for sugar and carbs are gone. Started taking at night a few hours before bed however, to try and deal with feeling unmotivated - that is about the only way I can describe it. I feel ""lazy"". The switch has been for a few days, and have noticed I feel more ambitious during the day, which is great. Issue now is headaches in the morning. My anxiety had been causing me chest pains and waking me up at night and the Celexa has completely helped that so it's been a godsend to have about 4 weeks of sleeping through the night, something I haven't had in about 4 years. So that in an of itself has helped with mood. In general, am happy with this, have noticed it does take more to climax, but hey, more nooky time isn't a bad thing :)"

I started taking it because I had extreme anxiety, racing thoughts.  It was tremendously helpful for me within 2 weeks.  It was a lifesaver.  I was taking 60.  My major complaint is I gained nearly 100 pounds within a year.  I have been able to get some of the weight off.  But, the benefit, mentally, outweighed the physical for me.

Problem is, now, I want to come off.  Any SSRI is a very slow, slow, SLOOOOOOOOOOOW process of coming off because of head zaps, feelings of spaciness, just feeling ""off"", but I have faith that little, by little, I will come off.  I would go back on it in a heartbeat if those symptoms returned.

I am and was almost completely homeopathic, natural medicine.  I had tried everything before Celexa.  Nothing worked as well. So, all in all, besides the weight gain (which not everyone gets), I recommend it."

Im NOT a violent person...never have been....but that medication made me a monster! Personally I believe theres been a misdiagnoses and I should be treated for possibly being bipolar! Im not a Dr. but I do have enough experience int the medical/mental health field, to know whats going on...and I do know myself better than she knows me, she met me ONCE...had me give her a run down of my life and meet with a pyschiatrist twice to decide that i've got PTSD and Im depressed! Im NOT depressed, I have chronic pain, but Im being treated for that, Ive got kids and a wonderful man...a great family and life...theres no reason to be depressed! Needless to say I took myself off the drug...regardless of the warnings...it was better to do that, than harm someone!! DONT TAKE THIS MEDICATION, IF YOU CAN AVOID IT...DO SO! BEST WISHES TO FINFING SOMETHING THAT WORKS WELL FOR YOU! I'm still holding onto hope theres something better, that WONT cause weight gain...I just spent the last 5 yrs losing 250+ lbs! I'd rather be thin and struggle with being bi-polar, than FAT AND STRUGGLE! It seems theres no happy medium these days! Good luck to everyone again, and I hope my post helps...someone!~

I ended up in the ER barely breathing. The ER doctor thought I had overdose on my betablocker, causing my heart rate to dropped. That was not the case, I was also on Celexa at the time. This a dangerous drug to take with betablockers.  I thought I was safe with my doctor but apparently not. I hope you can a least let other people know that they should not take betablockers with antidepressants, so they do not go through what I went through.

1987$Condition: Depression$9/16/2012 12:18:20 AM$Reviewer: Beth, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$4$I had been through months of chemo and then had surgery. My family and my surgeon felt I was not acting happy enough that the cancer was gone and were concerned that I was still sad over losing my breast and still needing pain meds (even though I was down to half doses). I was prescribed 10 mg. I was so nauseated I could not eat, couldn't stay awake during the day, and finally started being awakened multiple times at night with panic attacks, which was the end of my taking it. First day off had major headache, after that I was back to myself. I unfortunately learned to limit sharing my pain at my loss to my support group and my journal, but my family was convinced the antidepressant was working until they found out I hadn't taken it for a week. I am now hearing that the few days I was on it must have really helped me for over a week and am being pressured to go back on it or get a different one. Even if I hadn't had side effects, I think the real problem in my case was (and is) that there are people in my life who are not willing to give me time to heal emotionally, although they are very supportive of my need to heal physically. Perhaps the side effects even saved me from a worse problem of trying to get off it later. I think doctors are too quick to reach for the prescription pad, especially if depression is clearly situational. Counseling and acceptance (and maybe some hugs) would have been better.

I once tried to wean off of it with the help of my doctor when I was in college (I felt great and didn't think I needed it anymore) but the panic attacks returned so I've been consistently taking it and feel like a normal person! It originally took me about 2 weeks to fully adjust to the medication and help relieve my anxiety. Unlike what some people believe, I still have emotions! I cry, I get stressed, I feel joy, etc. I just feel like a normal person and that's all I could ask for. I did not gain weight either. The only side effect I have is occasionally I get ""brain farts"" which I like to call them when I have trouble remembering a fact or something! ha! (I've read this is a side effect of celexa) I can live with this because I feel like me and if you have had panic attacks you know how horrible they can be! My doctor says as long as I feel great I can take the drug as long as I want! :) Hope this helps anyone who is on the fence about celexa.  "

Thats great if you want to be a zombie and have no real feelings anymore. It felt sooo good to cry, I had missed it. I'm the type of guy that doesnt ever cry, and it was wonderful! I would not recommend this drug to anyone, unless you have been through some serious trama that you need to get through. Like I said you become like a zombie (no emotions)! You feel good all the time no matter what has happened in your life. If you want that, then this is the drug for you. Side effects were loss of sex drive totally!! My girl didnt like that at all!

Also taking during my pregnancy, my OB said it is safe for pregnant women. When I don't take Celexa, I become agoraphobic and cannot drive in the freeway or leave far from home. With Celexa I have no anxiet throughout the day like I used to. I do not know why I developed Panic Disorder, suspect I got it from my father. I made the mistake of weaning myself off Celexa last year, only to have my Panic and anxiety disorder come back. After I REstarted Celexa again in March, it took 2 and a half weeks to be able to come out of my home after being housebound for two weeks. When it starts to kick in, it takes about two to three weeks, and it didn't stop me from worrying about having a panic attack. I had to test the medication by forcing myself to drive alone around the neighborhood. After one week on it, I didn't get a racing heart, but could only drive 3 blocks. After two weeks on it I was  still hyperventilating a little bit when I drove 3 blocks. But after 2 and a half weeks on it, I was symptome free physically. It did not stop the mental thoughts of ""what if I get a panic atttack"". Those thoughts did not fade away until I drove around a farther and farther away from home a little everyday. Then after that, I didn't have worrisome thoughts after. Overall, I highly recommend it for Panic Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder, and Agoraphobia. I am taking 20 mg. But will like to raise it to 30 mg if I find a job where I have to communt ten miles each day.

She was started on 20 mgs then 40,then 50, then 60 and he wanted to take her to 80!  About 1 1/2 years ago I notice a change in her behavior.  My wife of 47 years was getting more distant and showed little or no affection.  Our relations are 0 now and we had always had a very affectionate and warm relationship, and that was gone.  The day it came to a head I put my arms around her in the kitchen one morning to give her a hug and she stood there like she was a robot with no feeling.  It hit me so hard for the rest of that day I though I would die of a broken heart.  This is when I started to to use Web MD to look into the meds that she was taking and found our what was going on because of the Celexa.  I talked to her Psychiatrist and he told me in so may words it wasn't any of my business and my wife was his patient.  ""What the heck about our marriage""?  I trusted these doctors and I feel they have made a bigger mess of my wife then when she started her treatment for depression.  I am glad after we had talked the doctor has changed her to Lexapro with Wellbutrin and the fog seems to be lifting, but she has a long way to go to get back to her normal self.  I feel that before our spouses are put on these medications the family members need to be brought in, and helped to understand what they need to do to be the support structure for the depressed member.  If the member getting the help loses the love and support of the spouse it will make things much worse for the for the marriage an relationship. I would like to see the family member have several sections together and maybe work through the depression if possible before the SSRI medications are prescribed,  I feel that the patient becomes addicted to these medications.  I love my wife very much after all of these years and I wish I would have been included with the therapy that she was being prescribed and not pushed on the side."

I was having a lot of anxiety problems which I could not control (started w/the death of my Dad). I was warned that I would gain weight and lose my sex drive and maybe have upset stomach. None has happened. This drug has been great for me. I do find that there are times it seems more affective than others. I have also heard that with women, anxiety can creap up on you based on changes in hormones. I am a 53 yr old female and post menopausal. This maybe is why there are times where I feel a little less under control - but this happens pretty rarely. I do not want to stay on this drug forever.

I am a male, 34, weigh 195lbs, with a very high metabolism. Diagnosed with GAD back in 2001 after a panic attack / excessive sweating (Hyperhidrosis) / general feeling that something bad was gonna happen (post 9/11?). Anxiety / Depression are in my family history. I have been taking .25mg of xanax as needed during this period of time with good results. After getting a new (and very stressful) job in May, it didn't take long for my anxiety disorder to intensify and lead to a higher level of depression, with the first ever suicidal thoughts coming over the holiday break. The stress of the ridiculous unrealistic expectations of my employer combined with the responsibility that if I mess up our soldiers lives are at risk was too much to bare. I began double dosing my xanax just to get thru the work day and drinking heavily after work almost daily. Mood swings were out of control and I would just cry. Decided to go on LOA and spoke with my PCP about my issues. She prescribed the Celexa and asked me to go back to taking the .25 xanax as needed instead of daily. I also began seeing a counselor who agreed with the PCP about trying Celexa. After my first dose yesterday I almost instantly felt some side effects. Nausea, stomach pains (mild), light-headed, excessive yawning, dry and bad taste in my mouth, shortness of breathe, and sweating of hands / feet / underarms is on a new level. Also feel lethargic and like a zombie. I will post again in a few weeks once I have more experience with the drug.

2110$Condition: Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$1/25/2012 7:20:21 PM$Reviewer: emmaemma, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$3$5$" I started taking Celexa about a week ago and so far I am just ""okay"". I suffer from a generally panicky and anxious mood(which is usually almost all day long) and low grade panic attacks when I have to do oral presentations(which is almost every other day). I've noticed that I do not feel as anxious as I used to; I can now eat breakfast and lunch which I was unable to do before because of my anxiety. I can say that it is a major improve over what I was experiencing before. 

 The first day I had really bad nausea(maybe or maybe not because I was anxious about taking the SSRI) and now I'm just exhausted. I yawn constantly and feel drowsy in my classes; I'm also sleeping more than I used to. But I'd rather be drowsy than hyped  up and nauseated on nervous energy. So overall - I'm hopeful about the drug. I also have had loss of libido. No depression. No suicidal thoughts.

2138$Condition: Depression$12/5/2011 5:17:31 PM$Reviewer: Stephanie, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$4$5$I was taking Lexapro for a few years before switching to Celexa due to insurance.  I had some unforseen circumstances that had me getting really depressed, unmotivated, and lack of energy, so my Dr. had increased my Lexapro from 10 mg to 20 mg.  When insurance became an issue I switched to Celexa 40mg.  When I had increased my Lexapro dose I found I was almost emotionless, and I found myself being forgetfull.  I also was experiencing a decrease interest in sex.  When I switched to Celexa those side effects disappeared.  I found myself being more motivated, feeling happy emotions again, and my sexual desire went almost back to normal.  I did notice when switching to Celexa that I experienced frequent yawning, but this went away after a month or so.  I have noticed that I have gained a bit of weight since I switched to Celexa, but I have not been on it long enough or gained enough weight to know for sure if Celexa is the reason.  I haven't had any change in my diet or activity level (I eat very healthy and i'm pretty active).  Overall I am very satisfied with this drug.  Although I was doing great using the lower dose of Lexapro, the Celexa worked much better for me when increasing the dose.  As with all anti depressants you have to wait 6-8 weeks to see the full effects and really know if it's working for you.

The doctor switched me to Celexa (citolapram) and I've been on it for about 2 years now for my depression and it has been working fin.  But like a dummy, I felt so good that I took myself off without speaking with my doctor and now I'm back to being depressed and had to be admitted to the hospital. They put me back on Celexa. Just been 2 weeks and still depressed. they told me that it will take about 4 - 6 weeks to be back. Hope so, for my sake and my family's. I'll never do that again!

I started off with 20mg for 2 weeks...no noticable difference with my symptoms. My dr. bumped it up to 40mg. Ive been on the 40mg for about a month and i can tell a big difference as far as the depression goes. The anxiety has lessened some. However at my next appt. i am definately going to ask about other medications due to the fact that i CAN NOT stop yawning. It is literally driving me insane.

i began using Lexapro due to a lot of anxiety and mild depression.  I fought through the earlier side-effects (jitteriness, clenching my jaws, some suicidal thoughts but not intense) and then began feeling better (more relaxed and not dwelling on particular negative thoughts).  After a couple of years, I reduced dose from 10mg to 5mg.  After 3-4 years at 5mg, 
I then weaned myself off over a six month period.  Within a few weeks, I felt very irritable and a little out of control, emotionally.  My wife sent me back to the doctor and was prescribed Celexa 20mg.  It helped immediately.  I've taken it for the past year without any noticable side-effects.  I'm 58 and very active.  I do go to the local YMCA about 5 days a week and run about 15 miles a week on the treadmill as well as using other exercise equipment.  I am a big advocate of using exercise to treat anxiety and depression.  Celexa and exercise has been a good combination for me.  I had always been fit and trim before my son died.  I gained about 15 pounds and had trouble being focused to lose weight.  During the past year I have lost 15 pounds and feel much, much better.  I won't give Celexa all of the credit, but I think it has helped.  I would recommend it for mild/moderate depression and anxiety."

2178$Condition: Panic Disorder$10/4/2011 8:18:44 AM$Reviewer: TheThing, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$3$5$"I was prescribed Celexa and Ativan for panic disorder and depression about 4 months ago.  The Celexa has been helpful for my depression, but has not done much for my anxiety/panic attacks.  Combined with the Ativan it reduces the panic attacks, but I still have a lot of anxiety just from anticipation of certain situations.  

I wanted to write a review to address the issue of weight gain.  Before taking Celexa I was very active, mostly with weight lifting and mountain biking.  I was in pretty good shape and had 13% bf at 195lbs. I don't think Celexa causes weight gain.  What happens, at least in my case, is that I got so tired that I lost the motivation to  go to the gym and after about 3 weeks I no longer went to the Gym at all.  So for 3 months I have not exercised at all and have gained some fat weight.  My weight on the scale is about the same, but my body composition is different.  I think after awhile your body gets used to the chemical and you are not so tired.  I have just recently started back at the gym, so maybe I can get back in shape while on Celexa. 

Another topic I wanted to hit on is anxiety.  Celexa does not do much for anxiety. I think that it can help you  break through some depression which might help you to get motivated to do something about your anxiety.  This is how it has worked in my cause.  Unfortunately I think anxiety is something  I will have to struggle with forever."

My mind worried constantly every day and I could not break the cycle.  Therapy helped control the worrying but it took me hours of soothing myself before my anxiety would start to decrease.  I was on blood pressure medication as well since my anxiety was so high.  This went on for 3 years.  Since taking Celexa, my mind no longer worries endlessly and my blood pressure is back to normal.  I have regained my life and it is a miracle.  I would highly recommend this drug.  Before I had no quality of life and now I feel very happy.  I was up to 40 mg. at one time early on but found that if I took a nap, I was down for hours.  I was sleeping very deeply.  Now that I have cut back to 20 mg. my sleep is better.  I do have some of the strange dreams, which is a side effect, but that is minimal compared to the tremendous relief that has come about in my life.

I finally went to the doctor, and he diagnosed me with severe depression and anxiety. so he put me on 20mg of Celexa, and it has worked wonders. I have moments where i'm down, but they're not as severe as before. i don't cry as often. and i don't think about ways i could kill myself and make it look like an accident. i'm such a happy person now. it's great. everyone enjoys being around me. and i can actually carry on a converstion with someone. the side affects were crazy at first. i was so sick to my stomach, and i yawned so much. but those are long gone, and i would highly reccomend anyone to take this anti-depressant.

Side effects suck, caused more anxiety than it cured. Made me sleepy during the day and no sexual desire. Gave me tremors and weird brain freezes where I couldn't think straight.  I slowly filed the dosage down over several weeks and have finally stopped using it. I didn't experience withdrawal symptoms too bad.  New research found it caused heart problems at > 40 mg.  Never take it again.  I don't care what the doctors tell you.  These pills are poison, they may relieve your sypmtoms for a while, but when you try to get off them it's like a psychotic nightmare.  The doctors have no idea how horrible the withdrawal is from these medications.  Some people never return to normal after stopping.  Before taking any depression meds have your doctor give you several suggested ones to review before you select one. Try to find one that doesn't cause horrible withdrawal symptoms or have side effects worse than being depressed.  Good luck.

I ran into a jam & ended up running out of my Lexapro and was unable to pay the $85 co-pay for my 3 mo. supply so was put on 40 mg Celexa temporarily, as it's WAY cheaper.  

Other than feeling a bit zombiefied, it definitly keeps me calm, but I also take Xanax XR 1mg at bedtime so that may have something to do with it too.  

I've also noticed I dont have as much energy on this medicine and have a tendency to space out more than with the Lexapro. 

Had a dr. appt today and we both agreed I should get back on the Lexapro as soon as my finances permit.

Overall, the Celexa works...just makes me kinda feel like the lights are on, but nobody's home."

I only lasted on it for 11 days, not long enough to feel the benefits but I'd rather deal with mild depression and take something else for anxiety than deal with the horrible side effects. Excessive sweating, I feel miserable even on a nice cool day, agitation sometimes, very bad nausea, although it went away after 4-5 days, constipation, blurred vision, and very intense jaw clenching which causes me bad tension headaches. My jaw and even my whole mouth hurts because I am clenching my teeth unconsciously. I had similar side effects with Zoloft, but not nearly as bad. Celexa is terrible! Makes me extra tired, and the yawning is annoying. I would never try it again!

I talked to the psychiatrist and he prescribed Celexa. I was hypervigiliant, thought about suicide all the time, I ate constantly, and I was so anxious about everyday life I couldn't concentrate.

Started off with the half a pill for seven days. I woke up with gloom and doom thoughts, rapid heartbeat the first two days on the half pill. On the third day I woke up, calm, with a normal heartbeat. I finally felt like myself. Went on the full dose (40 mg) four days later, but I could tell it was too much. I felt dead inside, just like I did with the Paxil I took two years ago, so I went back to the 20 mg dose after two weeks. I feel a little anxiety, but nothing like it was before. I feel like I can handle life now. I do have to remind myself to drink a lot more water because dryness seems to be a minor side effect. My appetite has also decreased. I eat when I'm hungry, not when I'm worried.  "

I was first placed on 5mg of Citalopram (twice a day)and 18 months later my dosage was increased to 10mg (d.i.d.) and I seriously doubt I would be alive today had it not been for Citalopram. I am now on a combination of drug therapies including Citalopram (10mg b.i.d), Buproprion XL (300 mg q.i.d.), Lorazepam (1mg q6h), and Trazedone (100mg at bedtime). I doubt I will ever return to what I consider a normal life, but I am at least able to leave my home now and go to the drug store and grocery store. I still have a great deal of trouble with social events, but that is also due to the fact that I have stage-4-COPD and am on oxygen 24-7 which has taken a huge psychological toll on me. This is not including the physical ravages that past HIV medications have had not only on my physical appearance, but my mental state as well. I was infected with HIV in July 1985, but not diagnosed until February 1986. I have suffered from severe wasting syndrome, lipidystrophy, and lipoatrophy due to the toxicity of the various medications I was on from 1986-2006.

However, recently, I have noticed that my energy levels are extreme - if I'm not staying busy, I freak out, I think maybe I need the ADHD meds again; I have absolutely no interest in sex; and I'm beginning to feel more anxious.

From day one I felt almost depressed but I read other peoples reviews and saw others experienced this aswell. After 4 weeks I went back to see him and by then I was in a worse mental state than I started with! I was completely deppressed and that isnt like me at all! I told my doc that the anxiety kinda went away but I was sweating soooo much, had a headache everytime I woke up and it messed up my sleep so much. He increased my does to 40mg and thats when I quit it cold turkey. Withdrawl was terrible for about 4-7 days(too many syptoms to even bother writing) and even after that initial 4-7 days went by, I was depressed far more than I EVER had been prior and this lasted about 2 months. This drug literally turned all my emotions off and I lost alot of time because of this drug. If this even helps one person then it was worth it. God bless

This has totally changed my life for the absolute better. I can control any mood swings I have, people notice I'm happier, I feel happier and more satisfied with life. I do get major headaches if I forget to take it more than 2 days in a row (I guess that is a good reminder to take it). I take it at bed as it makes me VERY sleepy and thus it helps me sleep. The only side effect I have is that I started talking in my sleep after I started to take this and the talking in the sleep has only gotten worse. I do not know I'm doing it but the ones who are around me notice that I'm doing it. It has killed my sex drive which I understand happens with a lot of anti-depressants but it totally took away my suicidal thoughts so I do not mind the loss of sex drive one bit. I'm happy that I found a doctor that put me on this and helped me find the right dosage so that I could return back to the land of the living.

For several months, I had been limiting my food intake to lose weight and my protein levels were probably low.  I did not share this with my provider as I did not know that it could impact the effects of Celexa.  I took the medicine for 1.5 months, starting with a low dosage. I developed a severe skin rash that has been diagnosed as an rare skin disorder.  The rash is still present on my back, arms, legs, and in my hairline.  The itching is unbearable and predisone did not relieve it.  In reading these posts, I read one from the woman whose sister committed suicide while on Celexa and that Celexa had become toxic because she had been dieting and her protein levels were low.  I believe that the Celexa became toxic in my system. Tell your doctor if you are dieting prior to taking this drug and be careful.  Celexa also made me like a zombie.
2264$Condition: Depression$7/7/2011 10:53:18 AM$Reviewer: Amylein17, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$2$5$This is a follow up review from July 2010. I took generic Celexa for 9-10 months. I gained about 10 pounds and was sleeping excessively. I would sleep 8 hours each night and still felt like I needed a nap every day. I went off this medicine to try ibuprpion to help me quit smoking. That was a failure-felt like a witch and it wasn't very effective at helping me stop smoking. After I went off ibupropion, I tried not taking any medicine, but rather supplements. I took 5HTP (for depression) and valerian root for anxiety for about a month. It helped a little, but not like AD medication. So I told my doctor I wanted something that made me feel like Celexa (happy, no worries, emotionally awesome), but that wouldn't make me hungry and sleepy all the time. She prescribed generic prozac which I've been taking for a little over a month. I really like it so far-normal appetite, sleeping ok, and feel good emotionally. I have noticed a bit of vaginal tenderness/inflammation, but I presume that is happening due to decreased frequency of sex. Other reviewers of generic prozac have said they've noticed it as well. As with Celexa, my libido has decreased, but that has actually helped since my partner has a weaker than libido than I did before depression hit. Overall, I'm very satisfied with generic prozac. Will follow up in the future if anything changes.

I was tired all of the time.  It made me feel high while it made my body rot away and become really weak.  I was encompassed by an all powerful apathy.  When I finally came to enough to ween myself off of this crap-it was like awakening out of a coma only to find yourself in another person's body.  I never had a weight problem before taking celexa.  I did not eat a lot while I was taking celexa, in fact it made me lose my appetite.  Exercise did not keep the weight off-it was a nightmare.  It has taken 4 months after stopping usage to get to a point to where the weight is finally coming off.  I was a very active dancer before usage-it destroyed the last thing that made me happy, MY BODY and my PHYSICAL STRENGTH.  It was not worth it.

I started to become more irritable and mood swings were present once again and have since spoke to my doctor about switching me to something else....she prescribed Pristiq.  I am only one week in and feeling better so far.  As far as Celexa, if and when you want to ween yourself off, doing so cold turkey will not work.  You will have to cut the pill in half or in 4's and get off that way.  I tried cold turkey and experience the worst side effects ever.  Vivid nightmares, electrical brain shocks, severe headaches.  Its not worth it.  Go slowly when getting off this med and know that it may take you up to 8 months as it took 6 months to get off in my case.  Good luck!

I have been taking the medication for about two months and felt the drug working very early on. I can personally say that the drug has made me feel even more depressed at times. My anxiety has also worsened and have since developed a major fear of panic attacks (which have occured in the past). I have experienced feelings of hopelessness and the feeling that I will never have another happy experience again. 
   The drug has also seemed to have a negative affect on my sleeping patterns. I often wake up many times throughout the night and sometimes have trouble falling back asleep on account of sad or depressing thoughts and feelings.
    My experiences with this drug has proved to me that all antidepressants do not work for everyone. There is still a chance that the drug will worsen your depression. "

I had been on the Lexapro for about 5 years before the change. My anxiety came back with a vengeance and I even developed depressive symptoms where I had none before. Impulse control went out the window. Two dosage increases later the doctor decided to try me on Cymbalta with no change, but anger control was now an additional issue. I was coming unwound!

Citalopram (celexa) was first prescribed to me in 20mg, but later proved to be too much (caused me MORE anxiety than i began with) and I dropped down to 10mg/once a day. *Sometimes, going up in your dosage is not always the right answer!* This medicine has worked wonders. At first, the side effects outweighed the benefits but I stuck through it. I gained about 10-15 lbs. in 2 months. But I'm happy, and hopeful. Took about 4-6 weeks to fully see benefits. I've been on it over a year now and continue to take it, no side effects anymore. Be patient to allow the side effects to wear off AND allow the full potential of the medicine to show through :)


          - about 6 months after being on celexa (citalopram) my doc also prescribed Bupropion (generic wellbutrin) 150mg/once a day. I feel amazing! And i've lost the weight I put on from celexa!

Has anyone else had an allergic reaction like this?  I'd be interested to know if the Celexa/Welbutrin really caused this because you'd think it would show up sooner and not wait for 10 days.

I will increase the dose to 40 mg at the end of 7 days.  My doctor prescribed it due to the current stress I am under (graduate school, a divorce, coming out).  So far I have not experienced the side effects my doctor told me to possibly expect during the first few days (flu-like symptoms). I noticed a difference 3 days into the treatment. The major mind-racing I used to experience is diminished and I feel more positive about my future and life in general.  So far so good!

I was on it for about 5 weeks and if it weren't for all the bad side effects I would definitely still be on it because it worked better than Prozac, Paxil,and Lexapro.  But the nasty side effects included nausea, fatigue, nightsweats, muscle aches, no libido, itchy rashy skin and big red dry blotches all over my face.  It also caused me to have short term memory problems- I couldn't even remember what I had cooked for dinner the previous night.  I have never experienced so many side effects and stopped taking it three days ago.  Now I'm having withdrawal symptoms which are no fun either.  :(

2402$Condition: Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$2/19/2011 12:16:09 PM$Reviewer: Gary, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$Depression and anxiety attacks gradually crept into my life. The last four years saw a random like up swing, first in anxiety attacks and then finally sudden and deep depression. I have been taking celexa for almost three weeks at the time of this writing. Day two I was on the treadmill watching tv and I caught myself laughing at the comedy show. My wife ran into the room and stood amazed it had been that long since she heard me laugh. My high school students even noticed that I was smiling and laughing in class. It is little things like this that show me how far I had slowly regressed over the years. I feel alive again. Social gatherings that used to be painful, due to fear of anxiety attacks, seem to have disappeared. It's like I keep waiting for the anxiety to take over, but it doesn't. So I am still adjusting to the new me. The first few days I had really bad headaches and dry mouth. Headaches are gone and I sip water, especially at night. I can't believe that little pill has changed my life in such a positive way. I thank God and my doctor every day. I don't know when the anxiety and resultant depression started. I had testicular cancer 30 years ago, maybe that was the trigger. All I know is that slowly over the last 30 years, I was ever so slowly changing for the worse. So I am learning to love life again. Take heart all of you who know what I am saying. I feel young again.

Was feeling hopeless, worthless and low self esteem. Celexa helped me begin to turn my life around. Began with 20mg, then 30mg, now on 40mg. This was just the start, I began to workout again, and enrolled in a variety of self help courses. I take multi vitamin supplements, 5-HTP, meletonin(sleep), DHEA(memory) and amino acids. Celexa is the most important part of my daily routine and the additional of supplements and self attention has increased it's effectiveness. IMHO. Only side effect is drousiness, so I take it 2 hours before bed. I still have bad days, don't we all, but I can snap out of them much faster than before celexa.
Good Luck."

It has taken away every single anxiety symptom I had! No more physical pain, stomach issues, migraines or racing thoughts. However, I have gained 35lbs. I exercise 6-7 days a week and eat less than 1600 calories a day so, this was excessive. The only other side effect I've had would be waking up in the middle of the night starving 1-3 times a week. I am currently in the process of switching to Prozac due to the excessive weight gain. Otherwise, I would definitely recommend this drug for anxiety issues. Its a great drug to try first. My weight gain is just a freak thing so don't be scared off. Trying it won't hurt! Also, if this is your first drug, as it was mine, give it at least 1-3 months to fully kick in. It did ease my physical anxiety symptoms immediately, but the racing thoughts didn't cease for at least a month into it. Good luck!

The first week was in a fog and yawned alot, but could tell right away, the medicine was helping.  Basically I had the same 'lifes problems', but did not get near as upset about them.  One common side affect for men is cannot ejaculate as easy.  For a guy this is somewhat of a benefit.  I can last a lot longer than I used to, which makes it good for my wife, but tends to tire her out. I had ED before taking and continue to take Viagra, so am not sure how this RX affects erection quality.

I've had both ever since i remember, but my social phobia got significantly worse in 9th grade. I woke up in the morning dreading the day and thinking of any excuse to give my mother not to go. During the summer i didn't leave the house or shower for 2 months and rarely ate. I read 24/7 to get my mind off depression. My mother got worried and sent me to therpy. I was diagnosed with social phobia, but kept my depression to myself. I was put on prozac for about a month. I got really hyper and woke up energized. I could not stop talking. My anxiety got better, but unfortunately my depression did not. I started self injuring and had trouble falling asleep. I've had suicidal thoughts before but i've always had a little bit of hope. One night i coudn't sleep and felt totally hopeless and started planing how i would kill myself. So i told my mom my medicine had kept me up and i needed to change it. I told my theripist that i coudn't sleep and that i felt hopeless the whole time on prozac. He told me that was impossible. Yeah, alright. They put me on celexa first on 10mg but that did nothing. They put me on 20mg and i take it at night because it makes me tired. I had no side effects. It has helped with the general feelings of anxiety. Like when i wake up in the morning i don't have to make excuses not to go to school. I can go to parties with my parents and can handle being around adults better, but once someone talks to me the anxiety lasts all day. So i'm feeling kinda bittersweet about it. I might have to up my dose or something. It hasn't helped my depression at all. I hope someone finds this helpful, haha.

I suffer from severe depression, but 10mg has helped so much, medication doesn't cure my disease, but it helps me to ""cure"" my reactions, my gifts and talents to people, those I love, and all I have to offer to this world. GREAT medication! I also take Klonopin and Seroquel for sleep as I have Bipolar II tendencies, I actually just think I am moody and there ain't nothing wrong with that! But...I am definately have the 'genes' of depression, and Celexa makes it easier."

The medication has been a great help at relieving my depression, however, one of the annoying side effects is a constant ringing in the ears (tinnitus).  I tried reducing the dosage to 10mg a day but this did not stop the tinnitus.  One of the beneficial side effects has been increased stamina and endurance during sex.  My wife loves it. 

Before Celexa, I was on Zoloft.  There was no tinnitus with Zoloft, however, the constant diarrhea was awful.

Once you are on it for awhile, make sure you taper off slowly and dont miss doses - withdrawal can have some pretty hefty side effects.  I will have to agree with memememe down below - works great but forget about ever having another orgasm unless you and your partner are very athletic or have serious stamina. I prefer Lexapro but this drug has roughly the same benefits/side effects and is MUCH cheaper!!  Another unpleasant issue seems to be the feeling of being absent minded.  Over all the side effects are better than the disease itself and I have managed to cope for a few years now.  If you are very sexually active you better skip this one....

But even on the lowest dose I felt terrible on it. It didn't do anything for my depression, which the doctor said I wasn't at a high enough dose or had it in my system long enough. But I suffered from extreme nausea, had an extremely dry mouth all the time, and felt very tired on the medication. I had to switch from taking it in the morning to taking it at night. I'm now on Paroxetine which does not give me any side effects as it is an extended release so it's less harsh on your stomach. For me, this one was a no go. The side effects were just as horrible as my depression.

I was consumed by anxiety which has been a lifelong problem since I was a child, resulting more and more in physical symptoms as I get older (frequent ""adrenaline rushes"", indigestion/IBS, chest tightness, prolonged pounding heartbeat and, recently, mild panic attacks that were interfering with my sleep and ability to function). 5 years ago at age 22, I first started taking Celexa 10mg. At the onset of my treatment I was very stressed out and nervous. I got a number of moderate side effects: heart palipatations, heart ""skipping a beat"", and one episode of very rapid heartbeat that was scary because I was not prepared for it. I stayed on the medication and within a week the side effects went away. 10mg was eventually reduced to 5mg because I found that 10mg resulted in too much of a relaxing effect (carelessness, lack of motivation). 5mg improved this considerably.  I stayed on 5mg for over a year and eventually went off the medication altogether at the direction of the doctor because my symptoms were under control. 2 yrs later, anxiety symptoms returned amidst new life changes and stress.  I went back on 5mg celexa to mitigate the physical symptoms I was having.  My latest bouts of anxiety prior to taking Celexa were very distracting and were affecting my body. I saw a cardiologist because my heart was constantly pounding, blood rushing in my head when I tried to sleep. They ruled out any physical cause so I started taking 5mg Celexa again. Have been very pleased with the results. This medication almost entirely eliminates the abnormal anxiety that I have experienced recently and at other points in my life. I am on a very low dose, which is enough for me to respond to, and I do not experience any negative side effects.  The medication does prolongue sexual performance even at this low dose (consider that to be a positive side effect not a negative one). "

Was increased to 80 mg/day for last 13 wks with no imporvement.  Problem is getting worse.  Not working for me and I am not willing to give more time.  Obsessions ruling my life and suicidal thought present regularally.  Sure it works for some but the continuing of the OCD is going to lead to loss of job(and possible life).  Probably going to try prozac.  Had been on prozac for 7 yrs prior to Celexa.  It seemed to work good but I stoped it myself for no good reason and ended up crashing and burnig and put in hospital in 99.  That's when they put me on Celexa.  I still remember a distinct shift in my attitude after about 3 wks when I  starting prozac.  I never did have that feeling with Celexa.  I think it may have never worked that well for me.  It may work for you.  Good luck to you all.

I was diagnosed with Major Depression and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. I take it once a day at night (with food to diminish any possible gastrointestinal side effects). I am feeling 100% better than I did just a few months ago. I could not be more satisfied with the outcome. Before, I could not sleep or focus on anything. I was nauseas and exhausted all of the time and I even felt so dizzy I couldnt drive or go to class. I am now falling asleep without the help of sleep-aids. I have energy again; I no longer sleep 8 hours and wake up feeling more exhausted than I did the night before. FOR ME this was the correct medication. NO MEDICATION IS CORRECT FOR EVERYONE. There are several negative reviews from individuals; take them with a grain of salt. Yes, the first week can be miserable on a new anti-depressant (you have serotonin receptors all over your body, including your brain, blood vessels and stomach. While your body is adjusting to the new levels of serotonin, you will probably feel nauseas and have a headache). You have to be patient though! After a week I could feel a difference, and after a month I felt great. I feel like my old self again. The only downside I can find with the drug is that I cannot drink AT ALL on this drug. As with most SSRIs, alcohol renders the medication ineffective because Alcohol occupies the same receptors in your body. Massive panic attacks came for an entire week after drinking moderately. I would happily give up alcohol for the rest of my life to NEVER feel the depression and anxiety ever again though. There are also sexual side effects, but for me they have been positive. I can now maintain an erection and have a healthy sex life. I also have no problem with having orgasms. Do not rule out any drug because of the reviews on here. Eventually, you WILL find the right drug for you :). HANG IN THERE!!

My first week I felt wasted drunk the entire time but it tapered of and since then I have felt great so long as I remember to take it. When I forget to take it the withdrawal symptoms are cripling; headaches, out of body feelings, tremmors, etc. The constant negatives I have experienced are constant fatigue, loss of appetite (lost 25 lbs in the last few months) sometimes I get irritated for no reason but not frequently. I really have not had a loss of sex drive which is unfortunate mine could stand to go down a bit. Overall Im very happy with it I feel more level and on the ball. I did try to take myself off of it at one point but was unsuccessful the side effects from quitting are unbarable severe nausea and dizziness crippling depression suicidal thoughts I could not summon the will to do anything I was physically and mentally destroyed they were enough to make me want to take it for the rest of my life. Do your research do not start this lightly it is a commitment and can really hurt you if you arent careful. The risks are worth the rewards if it works for you though.

The side effects were bad, to say the least.  The second day especially.  I was in a state of panic all day long, I couldn't sleep and felt jittery and drugged, my jaw was sore from clenching my teeth so much.  After three months or so I felt substantial relief from my attacks and stupidly I discontinued use (other reason for stopping was the complete lack of emotion and libido during sex).  Then two months later I was in the process of getting a new job.  After a call from the new employer I had an intense attack which was so bad I had to leave work early at my current job.  I immediately filled the prescription and started the painful first week adaption process again. This time I'm staying on it no matter what, every side effect is much better than panic attacks.

If I know I am going to be facing a trigger situation, I take my rescue medicine Klonapen (spelling?)and did just fine.  I've only had to use that maybe 3 times while waiting for the full effects of the Celexa.  The only negative side effect for me is excessive sweating.  Nothing uncontrolable, but during hot weather I could tell an increase.  However I'll take a little sweating over a panic attack any day!!

I had dry mouth but drank lots of water and chewed gum-it only lasted about 4 days. Yawned alot for about a week but then  it was gone. Cloudy (Paxil) head was gone within 2 days and now I can really put things into perspective compared to before. I feel stronger emotionally and more in control of situations. I feel human again.Have ringing in my ears still(which Doc says is unrelated--BUT I disagree--it is dealable though if this pill is going to work then I can deal !! Have been on it for 3wks. I haven't been as depressed and so far my anxiety hasn't bothered me. If anything it has made me realize I needed the help and am glad and proud of myself for getting it and the will-power to get more help if needed. Will continue to update.It is important to know that most people do NOT have bad side effects to antidepressants..They can however talk themselves into it by being so nervous of a side effect..I tried to look at it differently..I kept looking for all the good the pill is doing and making me feel rather then any thing possibly bad,which like I said was very minimum and dealable. Give it 1 1/2 wks. and see if it works for you (after all if you have the FLU you are sick that long also so take the pill and wait a week to decided. "

I didn't find that 60mg was any more effective than 40mg so have stuck at 40 for most of the time I have been taking it. 

I was prescribed this drug after taking many other anti-depressants which failed to help my mood, and as anxiety and panic were becoming more prominent in my depression we decided to try Celexa (citalopram). It has helped but only very slightly if I'm honest. I think for people who have mild-moderate depression it would probably be much more effective.

As it turned out I was diagnosed with Bipolar early 2009 and this is probably the reason why it hasn't been so effective for me, but I can confidently say that I have had no bad side effects with Celexa, and have found it one of the easiest SSRI's to tolerate in terms of side effects. 

Even though I have said I haven't noticed a massive difference from it, I have noticed that when I have tried to withdraw from it than my anxiety has become pretty bad again so maybe it has helped slightly more than I give it credit for! Regardless, I plan to continue taking it for the foreseeable future."

My insurance company was changed and my prescription went up from $30.00 to $135.00 per month.  I could no longer afford it.  I tried to slowly take myself off of Cymbalta but it was almost impossible.  The nightmares, out of body sensations, mind spinning, fever, nausea and flu-like sensations were too much to handle.  My doctor placed me on generic Celexa (Citalopram) 40 mg. per day instead.  It has worked beautifully and I have had no side effects whatsoever.  It costs less than $10.00 per month.  I'm happy with it!  "

2626$Condition: Depression$7/16/2010 11:51:11 AM$Reviewer: beth, 35-44 Female  (Patient) $5$5$5$This medication has been the only drug that has ever even touched me for the better. I used to think Paxil worked because I didnt know how much better it could be with celexa but almost immediately I felt like a new and improved girl. I never had a major depressive episode just an underlying dysthymia(low level depression)since high school. I always thought that I was just unhappy and that was that. About 6 years ago I started taking celexa after lexapro made me have zero improvement. The rest is history. The most wonderful drug in the world. Did gain about 10 pounds but that was the beginning and I would rather be 10 pounds heavier and happier then 10 pounds thinner and miserable. Now Im the thinnest I've ever been. I came to the conclusion that when you start taking the celexa you relax and arent as crazy about being a half a pound more. I always thought the other drugs I took(paxil, prozac, zoloft, wellbutrin, lexapro, buspar were working because I used to talk myself into the fact that I felt better when I felt no change. Celexa changed my life and showed me that its ok to try different drug and treatment modalities until something works because this is your life. You are worth it. Being happy is something we all(or at least I)was willing to give-up because I thought something was wrong with me because I never had much of an effect from anything. Take care people and take the time to find something that will help you!

Couldn't understand why I would swing moods, even a friend of mine commented and ask ""why are you always talking about death and dying? It made me think.  Now I have been on celexa for one year and my life has turned completely around. I don't pay people or their negative comments any attention. Had a compusive order to think about bad situations over and over in my head but now free of those repeated thoughts. Feel like living, not dying. There are those that don't believe in depression or that the symptoms are not real. But I am here to tell you that if I was not on this medication I would not have a job, friends or continued my education. Celexa gives me no side effects at all. I feel there is hope and I have finally really made long term goals. My daughter has recognized the change in me and I realize that this medicine is needed to function properly. Recently have had to increase it because body got immune to same dosage in my case. But it still has that wonderful affect on me. Back to my pleasant self again. After being ashamed to admit the problems in my life God has created a medicine to help those that truly need it.People love being around me now ....can't get rid of them!!(smile)."

I first started taking Celexa over 10 years ago. Within 2 weeks of starting, I felt great, almost euphoric. Over the years, this effect gradually waned until it had no effect and switched to other brands. No real effect. Ended up on Zoloft. No help. after being off Celexa a few years, I have started again, hoping for a return of the old magic. Started at 20mg for 2 weeks. Am now on 40mg and will increase to 6omg next week. So far, no noticeable improvement. Will keep it up for a few months. Don't know what I will do then.

2646$Condition: Depression$7/3/2010 11:33:38 AM$Reviewer: Piece of Work, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$3 yrs ago in the midst of an event-induced depression & anxiety, 1st tried Zoloft; no help. Then citalopram (generic) at 20mg.  Almost immediate relief (but event soon concluded, too).  That said, the spiraling, out-of-control despair, dread & nausea stopped.  With citalopram, it felt like I was blocked from obsessing about the recent unendurable concerns (I'll get cancer like my mother, the world is full of incomprehensible suffering, even if things are good for a time they won't last, there's no joy...)-- either I couldn't focus on them anymore or I was on a track where I could not derail into despair.  At the same time, sexual interest declined and even when aroused, I couldn't climax.    BTW, husband has urged me NOT to go off drug.  He said he'd rather give up sex than have to go through my being depressed again!  Dr suggested reducing amount to 5 mg/day.  Sex now is usually better but still infrequent.  Realize menopause could be responsible, too, not to mention boring old routines of a 25 year marriage!  Weight gain-- a little.  Could be menopause, too.   Then again, if the effect of citalopram is to prevent focus on the negative, it stands to reason that it would prevent focus on the positive (sex, getting things accomplished).  There are always trade-offs.

2680$Condition: Depression$6/7/2010 2:25:41 PM$Reviewer: Libra Lady, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$3$Have only been on 20mg Celexa with 75mg.Wellbutrin for several days but I can't seem to get used to it. Originally was on Prozac for years but recently discontinued it and went on 150mg Wellbutrin but became more agitated I thought. I cut the Celexa dose to 10 mg. and that does help some. Very tired, draggy, somewhat lethargic and jittery.  I guess I need to give it more time.  Does anyone take these meds at night or is it best to take them in the morning?

It has truly worked wonders for me.  I find myself being in a general better mood all the time.  I smile a whole lot more and even feel like dancing with joy sometimes.  I have not noticed any negative side effect with this med so I will probably be taking it for years to come.  It works well for me and I would recommend it to anyone!

This has done wonders! I didn't think I was depressed, but this has made me feel normal again. One side of effect for me though was increased engry (I was hyper for a month straight) and some problems concertating.
2685$Condition: Depression$6/3/2010 9:03:01 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $2$1$5$"I took Celexa for about a year and a half. At first I thought it was helping. I had been depressed for so long I don't think I knew what not feeling that way felt like. When my depression is bad I kind of feel like I have blinders on and there is blackness surrounding me, so the fact that that feeling was better I thought the Celexa was working. The longer I took it though, the more I began to realize that was not enough. Plus I wanted to sleep ALL THE TIME.  I would literally sleep all day and still sleep at night. I have back problems and my doctor had prescribed Neurotin and Buspar. These meds made the sleepiness even worse and did little for my back. 
After yet another fight with my husband about the fact that I was never in the mood for sex I begged my doctor to change my meds. She told me to wait another month and see if the sun coming out more now would help. It didn't so I got her to put me on Welbutrin which has helped with my depression and sex drive, but the side effects are really bad, so the search continues for an anti depressant that works and won't hurt my sex drive and doesn't have terrible side effects."

I also see a Psycologist for behavior modification.  The psycologist taught me how to regognize my early warning signs at the begining of a panic attack.  She also taught me a few relaxation exercises to calm down before I lose total control of my anxiety and go into a full panic attack.  Celexa has made me sleepy however, that is not a bad thing; I was unable to get a full night of rest previously.  Now when I wake up during the night, I am able to fall back asleep quickly.  My Dr is going to slowly take me off of Celexa at the end of six months.  I feel so great, I'm kinda afraid to go off the medication.  With God's help and the behavior modification I have learned, I will continue to feel great after stopping the medication.

I was prescribed at least 4 different antidepressants which all made me feel worse.  Than I was prescribed Celexa, I've been taking it for many years, 40mg day.  If I have to go without it while I'm waiting for my prescription by day 3 all of my symptoms are starting to come back.  However the generic Citalopram is useless for me.  I must have the brand.  My insurance pays $2 toward the brand and I end up paying about $220 for a 3 month supply.  Obviously if I could take the generic I certainly would.  This also helps (not completely) to control my hotflushes as I can not take hormone therapy because of having high BP and a slight stroke in the past."

2711$Condition: Depression$5/14/2010 3:36:23 PM$Reviewer: Ricardo, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$3$5$This medication has been very effective in relieving my depression and anxiety symptoms. These symptoms became lighter and lighter within 10 days of use.  After 2 weeks, both my anxiety and depression symptoms were completely under control. The only notable side effect has also been the most difficult to deal with. This drug actually prevents me from reaching climax during sexual intercourse. As orgasm approaches, I can literally feel myself hitting an emotional ceiling which prevents me from ejaculating. The amount of direct stimulation required to achieve orgasm greatly exceeds the capabilities of the female vagina; therefore, intense masturbation is the only way for me to achieve orgasm. Even then, the process can take several minutes and often, up to an hour.  This problem started within 10 days of starting my Celexa regimen.  Even when I take only half of the tablet, the emotional barrier is not diminished, and still makes orgasm/ejaculation extremely difficult to achieve.

These symptoms only lasted for about 10 -15 minutes, but I felt as though I was having a heart attack and decided to stop taking the meds. They did improve my mood/ calm me down, but I would rather be aggitated than to put my life in danger.

I really feel it made me want to drink alcohol and avoid my children.  It helped calm me and not snap at my kids but at the same time I could only deal with them in small spurts.  I would retreat outside to have a drink(alcohol) and a smoke and then come in feeling more able to deal.  I went from a drink during the weekend to everyday.  I'am so glad to be off it although I did it by going cold-turkey and it's made me feel a little lightheaded and I was a bit weepy at first.  I used Prozac 20 years ago for 2 years and that worked fine.  This citalopram makes me feel like I lost about a year of my life.  I did'nt feel present in my life as a wife and mother of 3.  It's been 10 days without it and my urge to drink and smoke cigarettes are gone.  Does anyone have any similiar experience?  I'm just really puzzled and without health insurance a sit down with a doctor is not a possibility.  Hope this helps.

He also has a broken nose that he has to have repaired, I also had thousands of dollars in medical bills, due to all the ambulances, and hospital stays! The only one good thing I could possibly say about this whole situation is I found my son a very caring devoted Dr. that actually listens to my sons problems, and doesn't tell me there is nothing they can do except give him anti-psychotic medication that he doesn't need, nor does he have any symptoms that would call for these medications...

Never do that!! Getting back on it feels awful, but taking it continuously really helped improve my mood & overall outlook on life. I fortunately did not gain weight since I was happier & more active. I Had a better self motivation to get out of the bed every morning & much easier time getting along with everyone, especially my co-workers since I work in a stressful environment, the ER. I had tried other antidepressants that just did not agree with me or made me feel as if I was walking around in a fog. But once I started taking celexa, I had no real side effects & I actually started to be able to live my life without the high stress levels, & my OCD accompanied with anxiety has been at an all-time low. I can say I am very satisfied :)

After a few weeks it got better and now i dont experiance the side effects anymore.  it has really helped my mood swings, and has allowed me to let the 'little' things go. Tho, at first that was hard for me because i wouldnt get upset over the things i used to get upset about and that would frusterate me. But eventually i learned that i was alright.

It certainly made my relationship with my wife, two young children, and my mother less than enjoyable, to put it mildly. I enjoy music again, and laugh a lot more. Gaining and maintaining a healthy looking weight has always been tough for me. I look better a little heavier and Celexa has increased my appetite and allowed me to gain 15 much needed pounds (I'm 170# now). I don't get NEARLY as upset at life's challenges. I started with 20 mg for about 3 months, but increased to 40mg and feel a lot better. I came off the meds for about 6 months and the old angry me came back. Oh well...whatever it takes for improve the LIFE experience. The only significant side effect I have is the ability to achieve orgasm. Erection is no prob but the O seems next to impossible. I tried wellbutrin for a few weeks to help with the O's but seemed to experience more aggression, so I quit that. Aside from that...this stuff is heaven sent.

I went to a doctor about my insomnia & ended up at the campus psych clinic. The doc there put me on Celexa for a mood disorder. I still had insomnia, but Celexa seemed to help in other ways at first. Then came the apathy. I didn't care about anything. I stopped cleaning the house. I would forget to eat. I could have an orgasm, but didn't want to be bothered with sex. I had no concept of dates or deadlines. I almost failed out of grad school because I just didn't give a damn. Physically the worst thing were the jaw problems. Jaw clenching is a known side effect. Mine was so bad I ended up with TMJ. I was in constant pain and in the end I couldn't open my mouth over an inch wide. The pain lessened when I stopped Celexa. I still can't fully open my mouth, but it is slowly getting better. 
My 'whatever attitude' has also slowly improved. 
I still go to the same doctor & we are exploring other options. (Now if I could only get some sleep.)

I stuck it out for about two months but ultimately, it did not work for me (20mg) and did not want to increase dosage due to side effects.

After we seperated I was mildly depressed and I couldn't do much because I felt like I was in a fog. I couldn't concentrate on anything. Thinking was a major chore. It was horrible. I was put on celexa and felt better within a week or two because I was able to think clear. However I still felt depressed and unmotivated, but at least now I could think better. Another reason I didn't care for it is because it made me really anxious. I suffered from some anxiety before and this seemed to not help with anxiety. I was nervous alot of the time, my jaw was clenching, and the main thing I couldn't tolerate this drug was because of the major neck pain. It was hard for me to fall asleep because of my neck pain which started within a day of taking celexa. I say if you have anxiety, this might not work for you, but everyone is different. I read alot of the reviews and it seems it worked for alot of people, but not for me. I am trying Lexapro next.

I have three wonderful children and an amazing husband. I NEVER thought people should take medication that ""took away"" from how they felt. After all, our emotions are what make us human, they are what determines who we are through how we act. I didn't feel comfortable addmitting I needed help, however, someone recomended I see a doctor for something just to ""take the edge off."" I do have a ""stress-related"" job, and was always either snappy or over-reacting to situations. This medicine has been a God-send. I am still me, I feel every emotion, and at the same time, I think more clearly therefore I process it better and more accurately. I have never tried any medication like this before, so I don't have anything to compare it to, but I know it works for me. I am SO thankful to my doctor who has helped improve my intire life with this medication. I started taking it for 2 weeks just a half of pill a day, then we increased the dosage to a full pill after the two weeks. I have been on it for a little over a month and not only did I notice a huge change, but so has everyone else-with all the feedback being positive. I can only tell the women thinking about this, or maybe you haven't thought about it but someone has mentioned it to you, you won't believe how entirely you can still feel like yourself, while at the same time your life has changed so dramatically! For the woman who has SO much going on, work, husband, children, home, errands, this just places things into focus, and allows you to prioritize without anxiety. Good luck and God Bless."

Upon research I noticed there is 60mg dosages but right now I feel as I am going backwards instead of forwards. For your information I also take Geodon 80mg twice a day, Gabapentin 300mg twice a day and Ativan 1mg twice a day.

Both the generic and the regular have the same side effects I guess. The first day i took it i felt a little odd. But over time, about a week I started noticing I could focus better and not repeat thoughts over and over again. The only problem that I have had with it, are my legs bother me alot when I'm laying down and sitting for even a few minutes. Also known as Restless Legs Symptoms. This is a side effect, and sadly it did effect me like that. Overall the drug worked pretty good on me, but I am changing to Zoloft, to control more of my anxiety.

I felt fine during my cycle, but afterwards my normal period symptoms intisified. So i decided to stop taking it. I experienced awful withdrawal symptoms for about a week and a half. Dramamine and fruit helped ease my nausea. Also if you are experiencing bad withdrawal symptoms be careful what pain killers you use for headaches. Tylenol made me get sick.  Also naps helped alot, so if you have the opportunity to rest, do it. And know that it will go away :)

Before Celexa, I had severe depression and extreme anxiety that would merge into full blown panic attacks. Celexa has been a life saver for me. The effectiveness has, of course, worn off some because I have taking it for so long but I refuse to taper off of it. I do not want to experience the severe depression and anxiety that I once experienced a long time ago. I do feel depressed at the moment and have anxiety as well (It has lost it's effectiveness), so my doctor has also prescribed me Xanax as needed and another anti-depressant called Pristiq. I have only tried Prestiq for 5 days but already do not like the extremely negative side effects I am experiencing so I plan to stop taking this. The Xanax has helped tremendously with my anxiety. I wished I could just keep increasing the MG of Celexa, but my doctor told me I am maxed out. I may research this and see how many MG is the max for this medication. Oh yeah, this medication has not caused any major side effects for me, even in the beginning. My sex drive is still as great as ever.

I do also know that depression runs in my family.  I have the type of nature that tries to deal with everything and was in denial that I needed any help of a medication.  People tell me that I have a calm demeanor and could not tell that I had been suffering inside.  I persistently dealt with it and now that I am on Celexa I definitely feel the difference.  I have been on it for about 3 years and started when I was experiencing extreme work related stress. On top of that I was experiencing menopause.  Then I lost my mother and have remained on it.  I was first put on Lexapro but it had an emotionally numbing effect on me. I have none of that with Celexa.  I am glad to find something without harsh side effects to my system.  I take it at night before I go to bed.  20 mg. Don't deny yourself the help you may need like I did for so many years.  Take care of yourself.  Talk to your doctor.

Scared me so badly that I quit taking the prescription for two months.  Just re-started two weeks ago, was cutting the 20mg dose into half and then half again!, and this made my side-effects less acute.  It will take me longer to get to where I am hoping to be with my depression, but the panic attacks aren't worth it. Just increased to 10mg two days ago and last night had an awful time trying to fall asleep - racing thoughts, anxiety...the scariest part was the feeling of heat through my chest, arms and face (like an acute hot flash or sunburn?).  It actually woke me up several times, this hot-flash symptom, and I would be drenched in sweat....wondering if anyone else had this side-effect too? I am hopeing that it goes away soon!

This is something new to me since I almost never experienced it, but as of right now it’s a daily occurrence.

I'm a male in my 20s, a hypochondriac with severe anxiety disorder. Before taking this drug I would drive myself to the ER consistently thinking I was having a heart attack. Also a major fear of vomiting - the slightest stomach ache or indigestion would send me over the edge, and I would be petrified, literally shaking and trembling all over. I began seeing a psychiatrist and he put me on Celexa. I have seen a major, major difference .. although, like I said, I'd give it a 90% overall.. I still get nervous every once in a while about vomiting, and I'll have to leave work or drive myself to my 'comfort zone' (aka - home).  But this happens maybe once every three months - as oppose to every day!!  I can live normally again thanks to this drug. I strongly suggest taking it consistently at the SAME TIME every day.  This will increase its effectiveness. I felt a little dizzy when I first starting taking it but that went away in about a week. Lost my sex drive for a few weeks but then it came back in full force (thankfully!)  Give it a chance, don't let the side effects scare you - they are very mild. Doesn't bother my stomach at all.  If I skip a day or two, and resume, I'll feel the effects about 2 or 3 days later, strangely enough - i'll get a dizzy spell and a mild panic attack, or get depressed (feel like crying and be fearful of losing my parents - very weird).  I might be a kook with all of my anxieties, etc, but celexa allows me to hide them in front of others.  Great drug overall.

So, while Im not in worse shape, def. not feeling better. The most prominant side effect has been on my sleeping patterns. Been waking up waay earlier than normal/before totally wired. Only reason I get back to sleep is from generic Ambien (take 1/2 with the Celexa b4 bed, then the other 1/2 when I wake up in the very early a.m). If not for that extra 1/2 pill, 4get it lol! Strangely, my sex drive has NOT really been effected. Bottom line, very ineffective for me. I feel flat at best. Gonna decrease off it asap.

A littel advertised side effect is ""disinhibition"". This caused me to make inappropriate comments and swear more etc...very weird! Unfortunately I lost my job over it before I discovered the cause and stopped taking the drug. When I stopped I found I was not depressed as badly as when I was on it and the anxiety had gone as well... this drug can be useful for short term use prior to counselling to deal with rather than bury the issues. I was also suffering from what is quaintly called ""suicidal ideation"" as I was convinced my family would be better off without me...really bad shit I think you'll agree! The reason for the disinhibition is that serotonin (which this drug increases in the brain to make you happier allegedly) is involved in your internal behaviour regulation. Really look out for this and the suicidal thoughts if you are taking this stuff esp long term.. at least it didn'tmake me sweat as much as Prozac did! good luck out there everyone."

I began it in June 09 at 20mg because I was feeling sad and depressed out of the blue.. Have never had depression ever before. So De. says try this.. After a week, I felt nausea constantly-felt just ill. By week 2- I began having ear pain and headaches with the nausea/loss of appetite and most days felt unable to function- went to Dr to see if I had ear infection. No-- asked if it could be the meds. Again NO..By week 3- I had lost 24 pounds. I was then waking up with indigestion (mind you I was barely eating), constant nausea, fatigue, headaches, feeling of absolute illness- Went again to Dr. asking is this the meds doing this..Again NO.  Began getting freaked that I had some sort of disease that I was gonna die or something. Spent most days on couch, sick as hell. Finally week 4-more weight loss, feeling weird crazy thoughts, didnt trust myself, afraid- worried, felt like I was going insane and this with all the physical complaints. At end of Week 4, I said I quit this med.  I stopped it, went to see my hemotologist in tears begging him to see if I had cancer or something (brain tumor) because I have never had headaches like that ever. Told him about the Celexa  and that the day before I stopped taking them. He looked at me and said, IT IS the MEDS..Told me about the half life and give it time to get out of my system. Sure enough less than one week later, I felt 100 times better. He offered for me to try Wellbutrin but I was super afraid of the same thing happening. So I declined. However again about 2 weeks ago began feeling sad, depressed, weird gloomy out of the blue--all my blood hormone tests are normal- so called the  Hemotologist and saw him. began taking the Wellbutrin 150 about 4 days ago. The only thing I noticed I felt a little better, some energy,little irritable today..Will see how it goes. I am taking a half dose of .5mg of xanax as well, since I am nervous about the side effect

I have had about 8 hours of sleep in the past 3 or 4 days. I told the dr. I'd try it and see if that effect wore off but I am done with this drug... so much for helping me sleep.

I am at work where we get internet access. My wife is 32 yo has been  diagnosed with PTSD, Bi-Polar, multi-personality disorder, anxiety, hypo thyroid disease, and depression. She is on abilify, clonazepam, levothyroxin. She was taking nerotriptilyn to help with sleep disorder but was removed from this and incresed the clonazepam at night. Been on Celexa for just over a week. At first she was tired all the time (was taking meds at night), then switched to mornings. That day she sleept all day long. Since that day, she has been not sleeping that long. She is smiling more and less talk about how she wants life to end or dwelling on the anxiety of life. She yawns a lot, but that is becoming less. The biggest problem she feels (and this is coming from her) is that she has a lack of sexual desire specifically decresed interest in sex and sexual ability. This fact is giving her a whole new and other reason for being depressed because sex is a part of our marriage that we both love. So has any married couples experienced this and have the sexual effects balanced out. Celexa works awesom for my wife, she has such a beautiful smile and laugh. I am falling in love with her all over again and it is great, just want the ""other"" effects to stop. "

Lexapro had really helped me with my depression, but it was too expensive ($93/month) and it raised my sex drive very high. My sex drive is normally good, but on Lexapro it felt like I was 15 again-which sounds great, but it was very distracting to say the least. 
So I switched to Celexa. The only effect I liked was a normal to at times, a reduced libido, which felt alright.
The other side effects were awful: headaches, very tired, irritable, and, worst of all, brain ""fog' all day. My memory was just shot, because of the fog- far worse than anything I'd experienced before I'd taken any anti-depressants. 
I'm switching to a different med today once I hear back from my doctor's office, for hopes of a better outcome. Just a note to consult your dr when you switch medications, I made the mistake of not letting them know what I was going through and stopped cold turkey a few days ago. Now I'm even more irritable and my wife's not too happy with me, to say the least.  "

Have tried Lexapro, Effexor and  Wellbutrin in the past for a very short time frame, all 3 gave me excrutiating headaches so I stopped taking them, not to mention severe anxiety and a general 
""weirded out"" feeling.
Have been taking Celexa 10mg for about 3 weeks now. I can tell you that I have not had headaches with the 10mg. My doctor wants to bump me up slowly to 20 or 40 mg, however, when I took 15mg, the headache was unbearable. My doctor suggested that I take it with two tylenols, which so far has been helpful. Haven't noticed a huge improvement in the depression, but I would say I am hopeful. Also, after reading some reviews, I started taking Celexa at night, so I am not groggy durig the day.
As a side note, I am also someone who eats very healthy, works out daily and has a lot of family support. Thus, I hope that I will be able to be on Celexa long enough to dig out of what I like to call my depression, ""the black hole"". 
Trust me, if you are sensitive to medications in general, especially AntiDepressants, Celexa may work for you. I pray that someone reads this and find it helpful!!"

This time it didn't seem to be working.  I also was hit with overwhelming anxiety because of my husband's job difficulties.  The doctor prescribed Celexa a couple of months ago.  After 3 weeks, I was ready to give up on this because it took longer to kick in than Zoloft. I also had terrible dry mouth and food just didn't taste good. But the Dr. bumped me up to 60 mg. and that really did the trick.  I only have dry mouth when I first wake up in the AM and food tastes good again.  My hubby said that on Zoloft I was more ""flat emotioned"" but on the Celexa, I have the normal ups and downs that everyone else has.  The only negative is that I am on the tired side, but not terribly bad.  It is a lot better than wanting to jump in front of a bus.  The best part is that a one month supply is only $4 at Walmart.  I urge everyone to give this a try and stick with it.  Good luck!"

It got to the point where I attempted suicide. I was having at least one big panic attack a day, couldn't handle crowds, all that junk. I couldn't take it anymore.
I was hospitalized and put on Wellbutrin and Ativan. These made things a ton worse - I couldn't handle anything. I would break down if I someone looked at me funny, and I went days at a time without sleep. I ended up taking every pill I had, trying to make it stop. Needless to say, I was hospitalized again and taken off those meds pretty quick.
Then I was given Celexa and oh my god, the panic and depression stopped. Not immediately, but it helped a lot. I could handle being inside again, with other people. Loud noises slowly stopped bothering me. Had it not been too late, I'd have fought my discharge (the paperwork had all gone through while I was in the hospital, and I left about a week later), because I was getting back to my normal self.
I haven't experienced any weight gain, except from the normal being home and not exercising and eating junk food. At first, the pills made me manic and jittery - I felt like I'd drunk about six cups of strong coffee in one go for the entire day, and couldn't wind down without taking a sedative. I normalized after a couple weeks. Celexa has worked out awesomely for me."

Its a type of drug that takes a while to get in your system to show progression. I haven't experienced any side effects, except the dry mouth, but I have experienced what I call ""serious side effects"". I've noticed a decrease in my urine (meaning that amount of times I go throughout the day) and also an increase in heart beat. I made note to my Pharmacists, but she suggest I go into my doctor's office for further suggestions. 

I persoanlly like this drug. It seems to work already. I was previously on Zoloft and the effects of that medicine took control ASAP it seemed. Not really a good medication for me, personally!    "

Her mental state has deteriorated to the point that she can no longer walk or feed herself. A blood test indicted an extremely high level of ammonia and Lactulose has been prescribed and started.

In the last year my panic was daily, buckled up and saw a psychiatrist who had me try this since I was NOT happy with the side effects of Paxil. Paxil made me feel like a zombie, but this did the exact opposite - made my panic so bad that even on 1mg (.5 xanax twice a day) I could not function. Had to quit after just 3 days of this. Don't want to have to pop xanax daily as it loses effectiveness, going to possibly try Zoloft next.

For 4 of those months I continued to self-medicate with marijuana on and off (hoping that the meds would be enough to help me quit, after two weeks, I no longer was able to hold out). I took 20mg for one week and then upped to 40mg ever since. In the beginning it made me dizzy and very tired. The drowsiness never subsided which is why I switched to taking it at night and have been ever since. When I had finally been able to stop smoking marijuana 4 months later, my anxiety had subsided and my depression blew up big time. I had many crying spells. I could not concentrate. I was very lethargic, as I had been the entire time, and the celexa was not helping that. What I needed was energy. I stopped taking the pill today with instructions from my doctor to switch immediately to 150mg of Effexor (which I'm pretty nervous about...) and the withdrawal effects I had were: vertigo, sweating, crying, severe depression. Celexa works for many people. It helped me out in the beginning, as it was the first time I had ever been on an antidepressant. But it never was consistent for me, and in the end my depression became unacceptable and the Celexa was doing nothing to help.

3076$Condition: Depression$7/7/2009 1:32:18 PM$Reviewer: RogerBaran, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$"I like this drug much better than Paxil. I have been on Celexa now for over 2 years and noticed improvement right away: Time didn't seem so collapsed -- I had ""room to think"" and a lot less ""knee jerk"" reactions to situations. 

My only concern is when I forget to take it -- the pressure in my head builds substantially and I feel very fatigued. However, with that warning sign I remember to take it immediately and I am ok again within an hour or so. If I don't take it for some reason (away from the house) then I seem to release the ""Darth Vader"" in me and I can become pretty unpleasant -- to anyone who happens to be around me at the time.

I have remedied the above situation by setting a special ringtone to an alarm on my cellphone. It goes off every day at 7:00am. When I hear that special ring I know to check myself to see if I have taken my medications.

Overall, I really like the way Celexa helps me manage life; way better than before. I also benefit from the return of my sex drive; which was almost totally gone while using paxil. All of the other drugs that I sampled seemed to have side effects that were unpleasant in one way or another. Not Celexa. It comes on mild from the start and smooths out the path quite nicely.

I am now in week 4 of treatment and I feel better than I ever have about life in general. Energy is down a bit but once i get moving then I am ok.

I do have emotions but they do not rule me.  I am on 10mg/day.  Do miss a more satisfying sex life but at least we have one now.  Before Cylexa-too emotional or angry to try!

A psychiatrist put me on 5 mg. 2x a day, but the AM dose left me too groggy, the 5 mg. PM dose gave me the kind of sleep I haven't had since I was a teenager (deep, wonderful dream-filled sleep).  After 3 weeks, my anxiety began to lesson, after 6 weeks I was walking around not holding onto walls.  It has changed me life.  I'm calmer & the little stuff doesn't bother me any more.  The 10 lb. I gained after breaking my back, I can't seem to lose, so weight loss is harder, my strong libido is nearly non-existent, but I don't care, I'm not filled with dread & anxiety.  I'm not worried all the time.  Close friends have noticed these changes.  After 9 months, I have no plans to discontinue it.  Some of the night sweats others are feeling are probably peri-menopause.  It is hard on the stomach, I took it with 2 75 mg. Zantac for the first 2 weeks, then 1 Zantac for another 2 weeks, now my stomach is used to it.  I take it before bedtime.  So the nausea others have experienced might be alleviated by taking it with a Zantac because Celexa is an acidic drug.  5 mg. works so well for me, I'm incredulous as to the high doses that others are on.  It does take 6 weeks for the full effect, so be paient.

It stopped the intense, uncontrolable, non-stop sobbing.  This drug tamed the excessive ruminating.  My angry, impatient, always-irritable personality was replaced with a sweet mellowness. My suicidal ideations ended. 
I took this medicine because of some very seriously painful life events. 
This drug saved my life.
The initial side effects: tense jaw, yawning, insomnia, and others, went away fairly quickly.  Celexa kicked in within a week.  This medicine numbed my horribly raw, painful, extremely depressed feelings. I could not stop crying, for literally a year before starting Celexa.  My ruminating was like torture.  I was wonderfully mellow and fairly happy once again.
Long term effects included being pretty much emotionless.  I could not cry even if I wanted to.  My passionate, creative characteristics faded away.  I loved to sleep. My ambitions waned. I was definitely sugar coated and in my own little content, semi-zombie world.  But, I really needed that at the time....really, really needed it.
I think I gained some weight too while on Celexa.  Hard to pinpoint exactly why.
I decided to stop Celexa just 2 1/2 weeks ago.  I am thinking that I might be able to, maybe, not need it anymore.  I am going to try anyway. I want to get some of my old ambition back...my creativity....I miss the good intense feelings of love for my family.  I was kind of flat when it came to that. I was on 40 mg...Took 20mg for a week...then 10 mg for 3 days...now, zero meds. It was easy at first. Now, the brain zaps, whooshes are plentiful.  I feel sad and teary at times.  But that is ok...I am not afraid to cry....I think I just need to get used to emotions again.  I was very nauseous the first 10 days.  That is gone now.  I do have to stomach cramps now.  I am irritable, very tired, and just don't feel so great, overall.  But I am hoping all this will ease away eventually.  I sure am going to give it a good shot!  Quiting smoking was much harder!! LOL!

When i was on the 20mg my anxiety was more or less gone but my depression and mood was still the same. Ive been on 40mg for about a week and a half now and feel amazing! I havent felt this great in years. And I've lost 9 lbs! I know everyones experiences are different but I found it helpful to read reviews when I first started.

As for side effects for the first week i felt like absolute crap. Headache, sick, no appetite what so ever, shaky, kind of tippy on my feet...but those have faded. I do have a little bit of a metallic taste in my mouth at times but nothing unbearable...

It caused horrendous side effects  and I ended up in the ER after taking it for 17 days (doc said it would all be better after two weeks). I was out sick from work for two week in an attemp to get adjusted to the med. It caused severe night sweeats, sleep disturbance, worsened the anxiety to the point of my brain being completely manic/aggitated and could not concentrate on the minor of things (TV!). It was explained to me by a psych doctor, after the fact, that the reason I had this reaction is because the med is for anxiety AND depression. Since I did not suffer from depression it simply added 'gasoline to the fire' by speeding up my brain - tenfold! Worse than any anxiety I have EVER experienced! I am now on Buspar and have not experienced any side effects.

No sexual interest.  Unable to maintain erection.  Also made me unable to climax.  Eventually the medication seemed to stop working, so my Dr. prescribed 40mg.  Didn't notice much difference other than my abililty to climax returned but my interest in sex is NOT there.  I haven't been able to have sex in a year.  To aide the celexa, and after a suicide attempt, my Dr. also prescribed 150mg of wellbutrin.  This combo proved to be effective for a while with me taking the celexa at bedtime and the wellbutrin in the morning. Eventually that became less effective also so my wellbutrin dosage was increased to 300mg (2 150mg tablets) and I was advised to taper off of celexa by taking 1/2 a tablet at bedtime for a week, then 1/2 tablet every other day.  My withdrawls have been pretty bad...I experience muscle tremors, nausea, vomitting, dizziness, loss of appetite, headaches, and an inability to focus because of the symptoms.  I would recommed exhausting every possible avenue to treat depression without medication because eventually you're left over-medicated, and miserable because of side effects or withdrawls.  I plan to continue tapering off of celexa and then work at tapering off of wellbutrin.  I'm also planning to find a new therapist or some sort of support group, and start going back to church because I still don't feel like I'm living.  I seriously hope something I've said resonates, and helps someone to make an informed decision about their own treatment options.  Gotta go lie down because I just vomitted and my head is pounding.  BE WISE and BE WELL!!!

3117$Condition: Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$6/4/2009 3:07:40 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$4$5$Status migrainosous was my original diagnosis with overwhelming stress as the primary factor. The Celexa was prescribed to help me get the repeated anxiety under control. As it was very effective, the Celexa really calmed me down to the point where I was to take every other night and now I'm not supposed to take it anymore. I took Celexa for 3 months and am now three days off the drug. I can feel the difference the Celexa made with the treatment of the debilitating migraines. I did suffer with low libido but all SSRI's have this side effect and that was something I could temporarily live with, as long as I didn't have to stay on the medication too long. The decreased dosage to every other day helped with this side effect only a little. Regardless, the Celexa was very effective in the treatment of my anxiety portion of status migrainosous. However when you come off Celexa (like it says), you will have headaches until your body re-adjusts to life without Celexa. I hope I re-adjust soon. Although the anxiety has been reduced with the help of Celexa and stress counseling, the migraines I took it for have come back in force. Not good! My doctor was trying to get me down to 8 migraines a month; I've taken my migraine medicine now 4 times in 3 days. To let you know, however, status migrainosous is very rare and most migraine sufferers will not have to use this product.

Side-effects seemed pretty intense, sexual being the most pervasive, decreased drive, pleasure, and an inability to reach orgasm really bothered me. It made me apathetic and affected my schoolwork negatively. Tiredness was common, I found it VERY hard to wake up in the morning, and if I could be awake enough, I usually didn't care enough about anything to wake up.  In my experience a good drug for a step up, to get things back on track, but not a permanent treatment for me.

While on celexa I felt numb and very much unlike myself. I was on anti-anxiety meds for one year and decided to go off them due my complete lack of interest in sex and didn't want to deal with what I was experiencing for the rest of my life. I kept thinking there has to be a better way and I tapered off over a 4 week period. Getting off celexa was one of the worst exp. of my life. I had headaches, brain zaps, I was sick to my stomach, nauseous all the time and had horrible mood swings for two full months. About three months after I stopped I had a horrible emotional break down. I was at my wits end and hit the internet to research natural ways to calm me down. After trying 5-htp (which helped a little) my boyfriend mentioned magnesium deficiency. I did a little research on the symptoms and found that all my symptoms pointed towards this. Muscle tension, anxiety and horrible obsessive thoughts, insomnia, etc. After I did a little research on which brand of mag. to buy, I decided on ""Slow Mag"". I took 4 tabs a day, two in the morning on an empty stomach and two in the evening on an empty stomach. I felt more relaxed and calm within a few hours of taking my first dose; my muscle tension seemed to just melt away. I've been taking slow mag everyday for a few weeks now and I have not felt this good in years! All symtomps I mentioned above are GONE!!! I urge everyone to please, please try mag first before giving in to the drugs our doctors push on us. Magnesium test are rarely able to detect a deficiency, so just give it a try and DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH! There is a large majority of people with this deficiency and don't know it. If you decide to give mag a try, please research brands and make sure you buy a quality supplement that includes calcium. I want to help as many people as I can, you don’t have to be a zombie! Good Luck!"

Normally I do pretty well with this combination.

Not as in the mood for sex as I used to be which is just fine with my wife.  Given being overly tired/feeling overly exhausted versus being severely depressed, I'll take the exhaustion.

Combined with CBT, celexa has brought me down to 10-20 panic attacks a year, as opposed to 10-20 a day. It sedates me a bit, and inspite of diet and exercise I have gained 50lbs on it. Like others have mentioned it has caused increased sweating, dry mouth, slightly decreased sex drive. On the upside,unless i tell them nobody would ever know i suffered from any mental illness. I also responded well for years to Desipramine, ok to lexapro, poorly to prozac, wellbutrin, topamax,and when unmedicated (by choice) found st. John's Wort to be slightly helpful (might help a person with less severe conditions). I would recommend Celexa in spite of some of the bothersome side effects, especially when the alternative in being so seriously ill as to be unable to work, eat, leave the house, socialize, sleep, drive, or even think ""clearly"".

Like so many of the strong people on here, I was fighting for my life with all of the anxiety I had encountered. My doctor prescribed Celexa and Ativan, and let me just say that it really helped me get back on my feet. I was really worried heading back to college that there was no way I'd be able to make it through, but after about a week and a half, closer to two weeks, the celexa began to take effect. For me, and I am the very like cautious and judgemental type, I noticed that the Celexa was helping in the little ways that made a huge difference in my daily lifestyle. In situations when I had normally broken down, I kept my cool and made it through. I would recommend this to anyone who is patient enough to let this drug take its effect in the body system. Since I got on Celexa, 20mg a day, my life has been manageable, something I would never have imagined possible after my rapid onset of panic attacks towards the end of my fall semester in college. A final note though to anyone who does decide to try this medication, it does prompt the ocassional bout of brain fog. You get used to it eventually, but it at times makes you a little ""too out of it."" Just avoid caffeine at all costs, its not a good component for someone using this medication- makes you ansy. Hope this helps someone."

Panic Attacks have gone away almost completely. Started off on 40mg, then down to 20mg, with little or no problem. Tried to go down to 10mg but was not enough to ease my day to day anxiety. Only side effects I've had was very tierd at first but then I started taking it right before I went to bed and that worked perfect. Some sexual side effects, seemed to be better at 20mg. Thats all I've experienced.

Be sure to tell your surgeon about this as most are not aware of it.  You should stop taking celexa a lease a week prior to surgery BUT it can cause severe withdrawl symptoms...crying and emotionalness and such.  I had such a bad reaction following knee surgery I was on crutches for weeks and I am still attending physical therapy to walk without a limp.

In September of 2007, I went through a rough time and after being diagnosed with PTSD, and two NEARLY successfull suicide attempts, I was put on celexa. The first few days I was Groggy but after a week, I felt wonderful. I was able to be myself again. Lately I have been suffering some of the same symptoms again even though I have not only taken the medication religiously, but also increased from 20 to 40 mg daily. I am seriously considering a new medication. 
3246$Condition: Depression$2/21/2009 6:04:18 AM$Reviewer: LotusFlower, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$"I was prescribed Celexa to deal with depression and some pretty bad bouts of anxiety I've been dealing with over the past few years.  I have been on this pill for about three weeks and have seen its benefits work right off the bat for me. My family repeatedly says to me about this ""glow"" they keep seeing on my face and how I seem to look more ""peaceful"" since my Celexa therapy began. Personally, I have more energy, am able to concentrate better at work and am more chipper than I used to be in the past. I have been researching this drug right after I started taking it and read about the many different ways people react to it. I have had some sexual side effects (that would be the only drawback), but they turned out to be not as bad as I initially thought. Furthermore, this drug has also helped me with overeating secondary to the anxiety. I am not sure there is such a thing as the ""perfect drug"", but I think Celexa comes pretty close to it. "

Over the last year I have had severe depression; sad, crying for no reason, just unhappy almost all of the time. I have tried everything. The doctor had me on Cymbalta for the depression and the Celexa for the overall anxiety. The doctor has been migrating me from Cymbalta to Wellbutrin. I am presently on 80mg of the Celexa. I take one pill in the morning and one in the evening.  I did this because I was having severe afternoon headaches by taking all 80mgs in the AM. I still have occasional headaches though.

I see a common thread in reading the reviews that insomnia is a side effect.
Amen to that. I have tried Lunesta, Advil PM, Tylenol PM, Benadryl and supplementing these with Melatonin and it is like I have taken nothing at all for sleep. I have mornings where I can't get up and I have to sleep in because of the insomnia. Anyone have any ideas? I am so glad that my depression has receeded but the insomnia will kill me if the depression doesn't."

I was less stressed, didn't contemplate negative thoughts as often, and was overall a more ""happy"" person.  I quote happy because it has always been my belief that depression is cause by actual occurrences in life, and the only way to truly cure yourself of depressive thoughts is to face the things that are difficult to face and ""take care of them"" thoroughly.  I feel that the drug simply makes things ""easier to deal with"" than it actually makes you happy or less depressed.  However, after nearly 3 months of drug therapy, I crashed very hard.  No suicidal thoughts, but I was ready to quit my job and divorce my wife even though we have three small children.  This episode didn't last even 24 hours, but it was one of the worst I had experience in my life.  This drug also made me extremely tired.  I simply could not get enough sleep almost as if I were a teenager once again.  After my ""crash"", I went off of the drug completely cold turkey.  During the first week being off of the drug, I felt almost drunk or high with a fuzzy state of mental being and a constant woozy feeling in my head.  During the second week, I suffered what I will call ""brain zaps"", nothing painful but once every 1-2 minutes I would get a quick ""unbalanced"" feeling in my head that would last no more than a second.  It is now early in my third week of being off of the drug, and the brain zaps are waning, but my feeling of lack of good sleep is still very persistent."

I feel good and happy and well adjusted but not manic or hyper, and the side affects are nonexistent.  I take it with Xanax to help with the anxiety component of depression and Celexa has by far been the most effective antidepressant for me.  It also comes in generic form (citalopram) so it is less expensive.

It's helped in the fact that I still have highs and lows. But I'm still having impulse issues and still hear voices. They are like arguments between two people. It's anoying. I used to have grand delusional impulses (see fight club) LOL I now just use that f----d up images in writting or art. I guess I really am crazy as they think I am.

I still experience drops in mental functioning and issues with sensory filters, as well as general anxiety and strong depression and lack of energy. During the first weeks, I experienced slight nausea, headaches, and tingling in my arms and face, which was not that bad. Each increase of dose was terrible and temporarily worsened for a few days the  symptoms I already had including heightened anxiety, shakiness, insomnia, sensory overload, falling, mental drops in functioning, and fear. I am glad however, that I took this medicine since it has helped with anxiety.

He agreed that Celexa is very similar (chemically speaking) to Lexapro, and agreed to the switch. Like others who have posted reviews of Celexa, I feel that I have a little less energy than usual, I tire more easily, and my appetite has decreased. These are mild side effects and I do not forsee them causing me to stop taking Celexa. I enjoy the fact that I've lost weight, as it definitely makes me feel good to have people comment on how thin I look! As far as my sex drive, there has been a decrease on my part, but my husband and I did not have sex very often before I started this drug, so it really hasn't been as issue. Overall, I feel much more at ease with life in general. I recommend this drug to others who are dealing with depression.

When it wasn't covered by my insurance, I switched to Celexa (citalopram). Worked well for me, but made me feel like a ""drone"" sometimes - almost too leveled out. Also completely lost sex drive. Decided that I wanted to stop meds in preparation for another pregnancy and also b/c I really don't want to be on them. I stopped cold turkey (after taking 40 mg) and it is STUPID! Do not do it! I would suggest tapering off for sure. I have had migraines, shakiness, tingling hands, dizziness, insomnia and anxiety attacks. WAY worse symptoms than before I started.

I slowly weened myself off the medication for several months, and still, I got the odd jolting sensations, and otherwise felt very strange for a good several months.  Honestly, I don't think I felt completely normal for a good six months.  I think the drug helped me, but coming off of it was not fun.

I have been on this tiny pill for a few years and I am so much better if I take it properly. Who cares if you gain 10 lbs? It is all about GETTING BETTER and that's the only reason to take and CONTINUE taking this medicine. If gaining a few pounds is the main thing you're worried about, you really have no major problems to medicate. I was clinically diagnosed with depression about 7 full years ago and I see a much better difference in my life while on this medication. I do not drink or even take Tylenol for minor pain; I was very scared about being on a ""pill."" If you are depressed, seriously depressed, don't hesitate on getting all the help you can get NOW.

I am on the generic version citalapram. I first was taking the generic version of Zoloft for about 4 months until I ended in the Psychriatric hospital for attmepting suicide. My doctor switched the medication to citalapram at that time and I have experienced the worst side effects, extreme hot flashes through out the day and night, nauseated during the night (severe feeling of vomiting), loss of appetite, food cravings for fast food, lost of interest in exercising ( I use to exercise 5 days per week), difficulty waking up in the morning for work, insomnia (unable to sleep), vivid dreams, nightmares, talking in my sleep (never use to do this before), anxious while at work, lost of interest in my career, depression has increased, and weight gain. Time to change medication and doctor because this is ridiculous. I rather just continue Therapy than take medication. About 4 years ago I had depression really bad and I never had to take medication, only Therapy, Therapy helped me a whole lot. My believes is medications is so overated, Therapy is the answer for me.  I am not happy with my current life on this medication. Good luck to all of you who swear by this medication, as for me I will be taking the Cognitive Behavioral approach to recovery for my depression,anxiety, and panic disorder.
3419$Condition: Depression$10/21/2008 4:18:20 PM$Reviewer: Suy, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$1$5$"I've had (undiagnosed) chronic depression as an ongoing background for years. Then last year I landed in a terrible work environment and chose to leave it, in a way that ended rather traumatically. I went to consulting and the shrink freaked out saying I am so depressed I must go on meds now. I was hardly sleeping every night. 

I went to my M.D. who was also enthusiastic about the treatment. ""You will still be yourself"", he said. He chose Celexa and put me on a very low dose (10 mg).

Well, I bought a month's worth and took it... for six days. Yes, the pain and self-immolation inside my mind were numbed. BUT The last thing I can say is that I was myself. I was definitely NOT.

Where to begin?
- I am a morning person, off and running as soon as the alarm goes and sometimes a bit before that on most days; suddenly I would roll around in bed unable to switch my mind on for an hour.
- My sexual appetite is quite healthy and wide-ranging. Overnight it was simply gone. I had never felt anything like it.
- Perhaps worst of all: I am a researcher. I use my brain for a living. I write research articles. But suddenly, by brain became a fuzzball. I could not think for one minute straight. Not because I had other stuff on my mind; because it became a fuzzball.

This thing seems to work for other people, maybe they are less sensitive to drugs in general. I know I am, and with all the pain, anger and depression I prefer to be myself than the numb slob I became when on this thing.

The good thing about stopping after such a short while is that the ""chill-off"" period was much shorter. Yet, 3 days after getting off Celexa I had a day of worse depression than I had ever felt. But that was it.

Since then I exercise on a daily basis, put a lot of effort into my research, and try to move my life back on track. It will never be easy - but believing that ""you can take a pill and it will be better"" is in my view no different than becoming a drug addict."

Downside is I have been experiencing some side effects that I hope go away.  I have gained weight, but that could also be due to stress levels, and I have noticed it's difficult for me to have an orgasm.  My boyfriend seems to be patient and understanding so that's a plus, but it is bothersome for me.  I would say the benefits are worth the side effects though.

I love this medication, it took me a long time to talk to a doctor about my depression because I was embarrassed, and he was a godsend in prescribing this.

It was very helpful for treating both diseases.  My main issue with the drug were the side effects: restless leg syndrome, insomnia for hours after taking drug and hypersomnia around 8 hours after taking it.  I also noticed that it made me very fidgety, my feet would always be twitching and I could never just sit still.  The fidgeting did not bother me, I'd often not notice it because the movement itself made me feel good (lessened the anxiousness).  The RLS was horrific, I could not sleep at night!  I tried taking it in the morning, but by 6pm I couldn't possibly keep myself awake, so I tried taking it before bed, but even if I was extremely fatigued, taking the med would make me become wide awake and I'd lay in bed for hours trying to fall asleep.  Someone mentioned taking it at lunch which I never tried, but might have been the solution.  Also, if I'd skip more than 2 doses, I would become so depressed to the point of feeling suicidal, which IS NOT ME!  I also gained close to 30lbs while on this med, sometimes gaining 5lbs in one week when my dose was increased.  I also had a lot of muscle fatigue and stiffness.  All in all, if you need it, it works well, I just couldn't take the SE anymore!

Went to my family dr. who put me on Celexa.  Have had prozac in past with no side effects. Questioned why Celexa,   was told this is better for anxiety. Was on Celexa for 12 days and everyday I became increasingly sicker. Told my doctor and was told these were side effects. Went to a different doc & therapist and both told me I had Serotonin syndrome.(can be fatal)  BE CAREFUL of this drug. My Symptoms were: Increased anxiety, hot flash that started at my lower abdomin and went up to my chin, rapid heart rate, high blood pressure(never had high blood pressure b/4), severe nausea, loss of appetite(couldn't even look at food.(lost 12 lbs in 2 weeks) muscle spasms, couldn't sleep and when tried to sleep the slightest noise made me jump out of my skin. Low grade fever 99.7, massive headache. By day 12 extreme dizziness and couldn't stand up due to weakness and balance loss. It took my body 8 days after stopping Celexa to return to almost normal. After this experience I will try to make it through anxiety without any meds. 
*Please Note I have learned a lesson from this experience if you have been diagnoised with anxiety or panic disorder I feel we are labeled by some of the  medical profession.  So any complaints or symptoms you experience might not be taken as serious as someone who has not been diagnoised with these disorders.    Please if you feel something isn't right with what's going on in your body listen to yourself and get a second opinion. "

I feel like a different person since I started taking this drug. I don't have panic attacks when I leave the house anymore, and my counting (OCD - I'm a numbers girl & used to count everything!) stopped within weeks of starting on this drug. 
   I've found that it's best to take it around noon, if you take it before bed you may not be able to sleep, and taken too early in the morning you may be sleepy all day. Noon works great for me! I sleep well at night, have energy in the morning and just don't feel run-down all day anymore.
   I have had some side effects, but I kinda love those too. I got Loss of Appetite and Dry Mouth, luckily enough. I have some serious weight to lose (about 90 pounds,) and now I have less of an appetite and drink about three times as much water as I used to. I lost 12 pounds the first month on this drug! So no complaints here.

3481$Condition: Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$9/1/2008 12:23:11 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$3$I  began taking Celexa about 3 months ago, and it has definitely helped.  My life just turned upside down, I left a good job for a bad job, took a cut in pay, family driving me crazy, feelings of not being good enough.  I am a single mom, work full time and attend school. The stress of it all was causing awful painc attacks.  I finally went to my Dr, and it was almost embarrassing.  At first I was sick to my stomach and couldn't really eat anything without wanting to vomit.  Dizzy, tired, all the time.  I decided to only take 1/2 a pill for a few weeks, then gradually to the whole pill.  Now I am adjusted.  I did stop taking it suddenly, thinking I was pregnant, but I do not recommend doing that!  I have been all emotional, and its like the side effects of coming off are worse than when I began to take it.  Its probably why I thought I was prego.  In all, I didn't think it would make a difference, but it has.  If you are unsure like I was, trust me, it helps.  Everyone around me can feel the difference as well.

I do have some weight gain I cannot take off no matter what, and also my sexual desire is next to nothing which my husband dislikes. I take it at night because it does make me tired during the day and I often take a sleep aid to sleep through the night. Nothing  too major just a Tylenol PM but the sleeping is a factor since I have a 2 year-old. I'd look for something else but don't have time to bother with it at this point.

I never knew I was truly depressed until in my late 20's my mother told me that she no longer enjoyed our conversations because I was always such a ""downer"".  My mother and I are very close and I decided right then and there to do something about it.  Zoloft and Prozac did nothing.  Effexor made me extremely sick to my stomach.  Was on Paxil for quite a while until I met my husband and wanted him to know that my lack of sex drive was not related to him. Wellbutrin put me in such a fog I walked around like a zombie, could not control my extremities and felt like my head was floating above my body.  Along came Lexapro and I was saved!!  Something finally worked well with my body chemistry(an my mother's as well) and didn't cause me strange side effects!!  Being that my insurance did not cover it, my doctor put me on Celexa (Lexapro's cousin) and I have never looked back.  I do not ""hide out"" or avoid social situations as much as I used to.  I laugh and love to make people laugh.  People that I confide in about taking an antidepresant can not believe that I actually NEED this.  That is how much this has helped me.  Lastly, the only side effect I get is if I forget to take it for a few days I will cry at the drop of a hat.  I will feel like crying over ANYTHING when I skip a dose/doses.  It is then I know I am off my routine... but no other side effects.  Hope this helps someone else."
3487$Condition: Depression$8/22/2008 8:14:00 AM$Reviewer: $4$4$5$I have been on Celexa for about 5 years now. The only time I've ever had a problem was when I have missed doses or stopped taking it all-together. One or two missed doses doesn't affect me but any more than that and I notice a big difference in my mood. While on this medication my anger, weepiness, and aggression are all relieved. I recommend it to anyone experiencing these feelings, however, if you also suffer from depression it shouldn't be your only method of treatment. Also, as with any medication, you should take it exactly as prescribed and try not to miss a dose or just stop taking it without consulting your physician.

It has worked very well for me.  Sometimes I still have some OCD symptoms, but overall I am very much improved.  I did have a decline in my ability to orgasm, but Wellbutrin has taken care of this issue.  My worst complaint is that I have VERY vivid dreams that sometimes leave me tired and make me feel as if I haven't slept.  My second complaint is that I have an increased startle reflex- which can be rather aggitating.  I take this (40 mg) with Wellbutrin (300 mg) and Trazadone (150 mg) and the combination has really changed my life.  I can leave the house, I don't count, I can touch things, I can also drink the water.  I am not drugged up or feel disconnected- I have previously had bad luck with Prozac and Paxil.

Instantly, major weight gain occurred and would not come off.  Tired all the time; over time had to increase dosage and then decrease when I got too anxious.  If forgot to take it for a day, sickness (stomach upset, nervousness) would occur.  When I finally decided I did not need it anymore (with my doctor's knowledge); I gradually decreased the dosage.  BE AWARE: There is no going ""cold turkey"" with this medicine; you will become very physically sick if you do.  I gradually cut back 5-10 mg about every three-five months as I could; then at the lowest dose, went every other day until the medication was finished.  The highest I was at was 60 mg.  It took about 2 years to get off the medication.  It was very tough; there was stomach upset; worry; diarhea; cold sweats; felt like my head was ""foggy"".  But it can be done.  If you feel you need to get off this medicine; talk to your doctor and give yourself A LOT of time (gradually; at least a year).  I really think your body and mind become dependent on it.  If I could do it, anyone can.  Best of Luck; be blessed."

You will not become sexually dysfunctional, you will just have to work at it a little longer.  Relieves anxiety, ocd, and extremely helpful with social phobias.

At first when on 20mg it was working great.  I had so much energy (lost about 6 pounds in 2 weeks) and I was enjoying play time with my children again. It was great, but about 2-3 weeks after that the engery went down.  I then moved up to 40mg and I still have not felt that burst of energy again.  I am very tired all day.  I don't sleep that great at night, but I do have two children under 4 years old and that may be the problem, but I truly believe in that first 3 weeks it was a miricle drug, now I am having second thoughts.  My anger, depression and short temper has improved greatly but I am just so tired all the time.  I can sleep 10 hours through the night and then get up for only about 4 hours then take a 3 hour nap.  That is just not exeptable for a mother of two.  I will continue on this med until my doctor has any other suggestions.

I do feel a little more tired than I would like; it feels as though I could lie down and take a nap all the time, but that's a better feeling than the alternative!

It did a good job tamping down on panic attacks.  I still had them, but they occured less often, and when they did they were way shorter and way less severe. They also seemed to decrease in frequency over time. The only side effect I noticed a lot was trouble orgasming (which I never had issues with before!)  I ended up going off it for that reason only.  I am now trying Wellbutrin, which solved the sexual side effect.  We'll see how the Panic attacks go on this one.

New doc doesn't like using Lorazepam as a maintenance drug and wanted to stop using it and increase Celexa. I began having side effects from Celexa @ 40mg dose (increase from 20mg Celexa and 2 mg Lorazepam daily). For me, Celexa @ 40 mg created too many side effects that were uncomfortable (migraines, blurred vision, muscle tremors, etc). Celexa @ 20-30 mg works well for me in conjunction wtih Lorazapam.

I take it at night, it helps me sleep (before it would be close to an hour before my mind would shut up for me to fall asleep).  I use to snap at my husband and family, not meaning too, but the celexa rid me of that.  Only side effect is that is slows me down, which sucks since I'm already always tired.  Got off of it once on my own and it caused headaches, realized how much it was helping me so I got back on.  It works for me!!  p.s. my mom takes it too and she did a total 360 for the good!!

Maybe the fact that I am more active, taking long walks, eating healthy, has helped me skip all those side effects that everyone talks about.
If you start on this medication I recommend to ALL to adjust your lifestyle as well. Go outside! Enjoy the sun! Exercise..Help yourself, don't expect the medicine to do it all for you. You need to put something for yourself too!

3579$Condition: Depression$4/6/2008 12:25:53 PM$Reviewer: Rose, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$5$4$I started taking Celexa in the AM because it has a tendency to keep me up at night. I have taken it for about 5 years after trying Paxil and Zoloft both of which had horrible side effects (paxil left me with dry heaves) and zoloft left me too spacey. I would recommend backing off on caffeine if you are taking Celexa in the AM because it gives you a boost and you may feel spacey if you have caffeine along with it. As with any drug, side effects seems worse at first but all of mine on Celexa went away after consistently taking it. I was nauseated at first but after my body got used to the AM routine it went away. Consistency with taking Celexa at the same time every day is what will help you notice a big differece. Like I said, PM doses keep me awake still, but it had no effect on weight, skin, sex drive, or ability to process thought (its actually helped me in all of those areas!)

My dr increased my dosage twice. I feel much better. I don't cry at the drop of a hat for no particular reason anymore. My thoughts seem more clear and not jumbled. My stressors are still there but this medication has helped me to handle them differently and not snap at people. That is the biggest difference that I've noticed. I like this however I don't want to stay on this for a long period of time. On my next dr visit I am going to discuss weaning off of this. If you are hesitant about trying this anti depressant, don't be. Talk with your dr

No more alcohol cravings-Trust me-Do Not Drink while on this stuff. It's crazy. Cures anxiety. Depression lifts but ambition decreases. Strange sexual side affects. Definite decrease in sex drive, but get sudden unexpected sexual urges. Gives you peace, but you quit caring about people quite as much. I became introspective and clear headed. I think other people are hilarious now. They seem like a joke to me. Before I felt the joke was on me.

It seems that some people are thrown on 40mg and no one is really monitoring their condition. Depression is not suppose to last for years and it seems that some people need to deal with the life issues  that continue to contribute to their depression. To those who have been depressed for a long time, it might be time to get a second opinion or an alternative diagnois. God Bless and good health.

Boy do I wish that I would have gotten on this 30 yrs. ago!  My whole outlook on everything has changed.  I handle situations differently, I react totally different, and the happy person that I have always been inside is now really shining outward.  My hyperness has gone away and I feel genuinly happy.  I am so grateful for this medicine.

I've gained about 20 pounds, but the medicine works so well for the depression, I'm not even upset about it.  The only problem I have is my period has gotten very irregular.  I'm not sure if this is because of the drug or because I turned 40 this summer.

Now the 1st month i was on it I was SO extremely happy- that has worn off but it is still effective for the most part.  I am only taking 20 mg.  It definitely helps you to deal with the small stuff, whereas before the small stuff seemed like big stuff.  So far so good.  I have had some headaces though and the first month or two could not sleep at night- that has subsided a bit.

Really helped turn those self-critical negative voices off in my head so I could concentrate on teaching myself to think differently. Took it at night but I wouldn't be able to sleep so I take it now in the mornings, no more issues with insomnia. Have very minor sexual side effects, however have had weight gain, about 15 pounds within the past year. I'm hoping to cut back on the dosage and eliminate taking it completely. Keep your fingers crossed!

For the first week I was nauseous right after taking it and had no appetite.  Once it started to kick in about 2 weeks later, I started to feel better, and now almost 2 months later I finally feel like myself again.  I don't feel overly good, I still have bad days, but I'm no longer obsessing over what I eat, I have energy to do things, I am focused in class, and I am enjoying myself when I should be.  Another plus, no decreased sex drive, which I was afraid of as I'd heard anti-depressants can do that.

I have gained weight (5 lbs), and my libido went way down after about 5 weeks of use. Currently on 10mg buspar to combat sexual side effects, which may help a little (hard to say).

3669$Condition: Panic Disorder$1/2/2008 5:35:45 PM$Reviewer: Ana, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$3$4$I have not been on the medication long enough to say for sure whether or not it has completely worked for me yet.  But adjusting to it has been extremely difficult. I am also on 60mg of Buspar. I have been taking it for 1 1/2 years, it worked well until recently. For the first few weeks on 10mg  I had a major increase in anxiety and anxiety attacks, had tremors, was very shakey, could not relax, trouble sleeping, and a decrease in sexual desire (well who wouldn't when you feel like this).  I was completely miserable and having to work full-time.  It took about 5 1/2 weeks before I felt okay. Without the help of Xanax to calm me down I would never have made it through it. I would have to take .25mg of Xanax with the Celexa every morning and on really bad days a few times throughout the day.  I highly recommend having Xanax or another drug similar on hand incase you have intense side effects. I have been told that I am more sensitive to it than others. I felt good for two weeks and then started having a lot of anxiety again. Was advised to increase my dose to 20mg of Celexa.  I still had the same side effects with the dose increase but not to the same extreme. It has been two weeks and I am not feeling completely myself yet.

I also feel more paranoid (is so and so mad at me?) on Celexa, another feeling that was masked on Lexapro. But the weight gain was not healthy.

It was not effective for that. I was also on Dexedrine for ADHd and immediately began having issues with that drug, which I had  responded ver well to and had almost immediately made vast improvements in my life. I CAN NOT IMAGINE  HOW  MUCH WORSE i WOULD HAVE BEEN WITHOUT IT AT THAT TIME. 
Almost immediately after starting Celexa, I began  having touble sleeeping, it was wrecking havoc on the dexedrine impact, making it not only innefective at the prescribed dose but causing me to have to use more than usuala s my symptoms worsened and I would be awake for days.
It was helpful whenI was in a depressive state, however I was also experiencing manic episodes before I started it, but had increased symptoms after taking it.
The depresion was so bad however that I did kept taking it.
The most frustrating apart was that  doctors all blamed the dexedrine, which actually  helped to manage the adverse side effects of the celexa. They all began to thinkI was addicted to the dexedrine because of the contraindaction with celexa (iformation that I found  on the webafter two years of this).
Overall- it was a horrible experience and did nothing to help  the panic which was the  biggest issue. It was however useful for the depression, unfortunately with  major adverse side effects."

It had gotten very bad with crying nonstop and even thinking about how to commit suicide.  I knew I needed help.  The celexa has been very helpful with the suicidal thoughts and the depression, the only things that bother me is I find it very hard to cry and like one of the other reviews I read, I feel numb.  I've only gained 2 pounds and this I believe is from the holiday eating as I've been on the med since September 2007 and just gained the weight in December. Sometimes I feel disconnected from things in life, but then I wonder if feeling normal finally instead of always crying and feeling suicidal and depressed is just taking some getting used to.  I really never had calmness like I do now on the celexa.  I've been on paxil and gained 50 pounds, on wellbutrin and lost weight but never on anything that has helped me this much. I hope I don't have to take this for the rest of my life, but if I do it's better than the life I was living.

I often wonder if it is better to fight the depression naturally and maintain a healthy weight, or remain on this drug and continue to gain weight, feel like I am in a fog and not remember a darn thing from one day to the next. It seems like it is a catch 22.

3723$Condition: Depression$12/3/2007 8:13:10 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$It was hard for me to admit I had mild depression and even more difficult for me to begin taking medication for it. I always felt like I should be able to control how I feel. I never felt suicidal, just blah and negative, so I admitted I could feel better and gave in to taking the medication and went to 3 counseling sessions, mainly to accept my depression. It has been a very positive experience for me and the medication has been working. I take 40mg 1x/day and I feel more positive about my life and my interactions with people. I had mild side effects for the first month, dry mouth, yawning, decreased sexual desire, but they went away. I now believe depression is an inbalance of chemicals in the brain because after taking Celexa, my thinking changed. I tried to change it on my own to be more positive, but it always felt like something was blocking me. I have now realized and accepted I have mild depression, and that is what was blocking me and I don't have the power to control it, and it's ok to get help with it.

I suffered from depression for years not knowing what it was and had a suicide attempt back in 1996.  I am aware of it's symptoms now and can usually get myself back on track without medications.  This time was different.  The gym didn't help, talking to people didn't help.  I am so glad that I had the courage to call my doctor and say I need help.  I hope I don't need to be on medication for ever, but I am a much better wife and mother on it right now.

Previously tried Paxil, which had the same side effect plus insomnia to boot. The sexual side effects are frustrating and I don't think anyone has a real solution for it.

3794$Condition: Other$9/29/2007 8:25:42 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$4$4$This medication has worked well for me. I take one dose a day for anxiety. However, a downfall to this may be the weight gain over time. I feel the medication causes faster weight gain than without it. It is important to get lots of exercize while on this medication. 
3795$Condition: Panic Disorder$9/28/2007 2:49:04 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$4$I'm taking 20mg for General Anxiety Disorder and depression.  It has helped with my anxiety and the physical problems as a result of my untreated anxiety.  Migranes and IBS are much better.  Although I still have some anxiety from time to time this has overall improved my stress.  I had some side effects in the beginning but they soon went away. My Dr says this is the best for non-weight gain but I think I still have to watch what I eat and exercise or I could put on weight.  I think a little more weight is better then the anxiety and stress.

but it has helped,w/my depression and night sweats.But I do not like the weight gain that has come w/it.I started w/20mg. and now I take 40mg.The main reason I started it was in 2006 I had a total hysterectomy and was put on it for my hot flashes and it worked and it also helped w/ all the crying and snapping at my children I was doing.But lately I feel like it is doing the job that it once did.
