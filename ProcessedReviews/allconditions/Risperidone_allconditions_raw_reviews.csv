4$Condition: Schizophrenia$10/20/2007 6:14:15 PM$Reviewer: Hey, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $1$1$2$I have 4 times the highest normal range  level of  prolactin in my blood. I have significant decrease in libido and my semen seems to not be forming I'm not sure how that effects the sperm to have something to swim in when being released. I have a climax which is significantly diminished in the pleasure aspect of the ejaculation and coitis is decreased. I have decreased motivation two to three days after my shot. The intensity of my climax does vary. I seem to have no increase in blood sugar readings. I have orthostatic hypotension 3 to 4 days after the injection of the risperdone consta.I am prescribed 50mgs once every two weeks. I have been administered this dose for one year. I started this regimen in 2004 discontinued in 2005,started again in October 2006. I find when not eating adequatley and especially missing sleep I still have symptoms with the risperidone consta. I consume moderate amounts of coffee when not eating but if I eat I don't get symptoms. I hope to use diet to control symtoms and nutritional supplements as a buffer to diet. Vitamin C helps quite a bit. I find those professionals involved in my recovery are unwilling to use the diet and the nutritional supplement approach. I hope to  be free of the traditional medication because of the side effects and adverse reactions. It is frustrating that the traditional Doctors do not recommend alternative thearpy instead of traditional medicine. Look into alternative medicine there are many other approaches besides traditional medicine. I have faith in naturopathic Doctors. Not every naturopathic Doctor is as good as some, so don't be discouraged if at first you don't have success. It matters how smart and informed the Doctor is that you are seeking.
5$Condition: Mania associated with Bipolar Disorder$9/25/2019 9:21:36 PM$Reviewer: Asiah , 13-18 on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $1$1$1$I had took this medication for a year, for bipolar, and psychosis I have gained 50lbs from this medicine and now Iâ??m 194lbs. It helped my anxiety , and manic issues but didnâ??t help my thoughts because now Iâ??m fat. I had no motivation, as well as no confidence . My thoughts would be racing non stop. I was on 2mg twice a day. Moved it to 1 and I was still experiencing bad symptoms; such as being very hungry, and very lazy. Iâ??d take it and get so relaxed I wouldnâ??t get up from my bed. Since I am off of it now, Iâ??ve gained all my motivation back, working out , walking, and able to control my eating . If anyone is experiencing these problems or trying to find out about this medicine , I recommend you to not take it . Unless you like being over weight. I am still taking something else for anxiety btw . Everything else is fine BUT this medication. Donâ??t take it .

Just came off Seroquel because of the nasty side effects!!! Then I see all these reviews of 30-150 lbs of weight gain, oh no way! I am so short, and have severe crippling back, I can't support 20 more pounds! I told my doctor that. But I have been on Latuda in the past as well. All three of these are Anti-psychotic drugs, women....you are lactating because the increase in prolactin in the pituitary gland (brain). My ob-gyn had me tested back in 2017. It wasn't the side effect ""missed periods"" it is more like, if you stay on this medication ladies, it STOPS ovulation. I know, I didn't have a menstrual cycle the entire time I took Latuda, and Risperidone is pretty much the same. I'm going to see how much weight I gain after a week, and I will weigh the pros and cons then."

I've been taking it for 3 days and so far, I had a very deep sleep last night but the first night I had insomnia. I'm starting to feel a little sedated. Will come back to review it when I've taken it for a longer period of time. I'm so scared I'm going to gain weight on this medicine because that's what I read like everywhere!

I can usually lose weight with a regular workout routine and just about any food. However, about 3-4 after taking this medicine if I eat some food from Denny's my metabolism is screwed. Maybe I should follow a low carb diet on this medication (50 g).

12$Condition: Psychosis caused by a Disease$3/20/2017 8:03:19 PM$Reviewer: NightChild, 13-18 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $3$3$3$"I am on 3mg of Riperidone. So far, I have gained 40  pounds because I have been off and on it. On days off, I sleep 12 or more hours a night, not including occasional 2 hour naps. When I don't sleep this much, I am tired beyond compare. I do not know if it affects my period since I am also on the Evra Patch Birth Control, but I do get tender leaky breasts. For me, this symptoms are livable. The only I don't care for is the weight gain, but I also don't exercise. Although I stayed in the mental ward for a week, it doesn't mean the medication didn't help. Without it, I wouldn't be the happy, fairly-stable person I am today. I have been on risperidone for 2 years and it helped me keep the psychosis reasonably quiet enough to let me learn how to cope with it on my own. At times, it'll seem like the medication isn't working it all. It will feel like you're on them for no reason. This is because there may be other causes (stress, etc.) that will make you have some ""mishaps"". It would of been a lot harder to handle my psychosis if I never took this medication. For me, it was worth it. However, it seems to have given me liver problems (waiting for diagnosis) and I may have to discontinue the meds. I think I am ready to take on my psychosis one-on-one."

It also gives them higher cholesterol. The older girl was taken off it for a little while by their doctor, and the had less appetite and lost weight, she's now a healthy weight. When she was on it the first time her cholesterol was high too. Strange thing was the doctor that gave her the medication sent her for the blood work and didn't even mention the results. It changed her mood, but it is not worth jeapordizing her arteries or her getting over weight again. The younger one is irratable, and tired when she's on it.

His psych doctor suggested this med in conjuction with fluoxetine for depression. The drug has worked, it took @4 weeks to become effective but he has gained 35lbs since. I am very concerned about the weight gain and he is taking the lowest dosage 1 mg. From one parent to another, definitely read the side effects and have a back up plan for the weight gain. Otherwise, the drug is very effective. Notice the difference and he is much better. I hope this helps for parents with teenagers.

27$Condition: Other$5/27/2014 2:47:48 AM$Reviewer: jerems82, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$4$2$"I first began taking Risperdal(name brand) in 2007, when I was having very serious psychological problems that involved terrible disorganized thinking, delusional thoughts, OCD, and Tourette's. I never heard any voices. It was just so bad, my disorganized thinking process, that I decided to get help in 2007, when I turned 25. In my late teens, I had tiny precursors but then at about 21, in 2003, I became so very sick. I lost my mind, literally. I could no longer pay attention, and was agitated, and had anxiety so bad. All of this plus terrible concentration problems. In 2007, the psychiatrist prescribed me Paxil, Klonopin, and Risperdal. It was just so amazing how much ""junk"" was cleared out of my head. It was like a really humid day, and then a cold front sweeps through and takes all of the moisture with it, and it becomes cool, dry, with no humidity. That's how I would describe these meds as feeling for about the 1st 3 to 3.5 years. Then I switched to a generic Risperidone, and began having some problems again. My Tourette's came back, in full force. My thoughts were once again scattered. Not as bad, but this was junk compared to Janssen's brand name ""Risperdal."" So I give the Risperidone up all together, and became nuts in the head again with thoughts and garbage flying everywhere in my head. So back on the generic I went. Since I switched to generic, the combo of Risperidone and Clonazepam has caused me much trouble with wetting the bed. I've tried to go off the Risperidone numerous times, but always got back on it due to the craziness in my head. The only complaint I have about Risperidone, is that the Generic isn't as good. Also, it makes me go crazy upon taking it. So I take it right before bedtime, literally. It is a wonderful drug because I have most of my mind and life back. Even though I've gained 150 lbs and have unpleasant side effects. It's great knowing I can have myself back, not all, but most of my old self with the amazing help of Risperidone. 9/10"

I have a mild dose, it lowers my anxiety, stress, stops any hallucinations (which I forget about), and helps me feel good throughout the day. Zyprexa nearly killed me with a rare side-effect, and Seroquel ruined my health drastically causing my gall-bladder to be affected (removed).

Doctor than lowered anti-depressant to lower dosage. Did gain some weight but I don't mind I'm so much happier.

No complaints, no side effects I'm aware of. Again I have been taking 1MG of Risperidone once a day at bedtime for years.

I'm more stable. Great product.

The anti-depressant is Effexor XR. I did try the generic version of Effexor XR released a few months ago.

Within 2 weeks I was back in the toliet with Depression.

And NO I don't have anything against using generics some of the other drugs I take are generic and they work fine.

Something must be different in the generic Effexor XR and the Namebrand. I was very surprized how quickly I slide back into depression.

Since being on this med he is moving slowly, experiencing muscle stiffness, feeling ""flat"" (emotionless), and having nervousness/restlessness, and mood swings.

During a forced admission to ICU when he visited a psychiatrist to talk about his MS (we were managing okay), he was started on this drug (37.5mg) & discharged into the community after 3 shots. All passion for living has gone completely. His depression is now so much worse than it has ever been, gained 13kg in a month, aching muscles despite lack of use. It is now almost 3 months since his final injection (we sent him out of the country to avoid the compulsory treatment order) & he is spending 20 hours a day in bed, can't manage to self care or exercise whereas he was previously a charismatic energetic skateboarder who mentored younger kids and exercised 5 hours a day. Bloods show tripled prolactin levels, elevated lipids & cholesterol damage. Although we are still hoping for some improvement, we can say without doubt that this drug has destroyed my sons life for more than 6 months, & that was only 3 injections. Be warned!

He thought our city was being poisoned by the water. While at our house he was asking if we had any guns.  He was so depressed, we were fearful of what he might do. He went back to his house to get some clothes. While there, he took all of his pills trying to commit suicide. When I went to check on him.

BP aTX, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $4$3$2$I took Risperdal when I entered treatment for Bipolar 1 (Major Depressive) along with alcohol and meth addiction (snorter).  I was in psychosis from the substance abuse and untreated bipolar. I needed the antipyschotic. It worked well to help me get back to reality. I experienced pretty bad side effects: rapid weight gain, major ticks and uncontrolled body movements, saliva gathering at creases in mouth, body core overheating without notice, extreme lethargy. But! I came back to reality during my seven months on the drug. And sixty five pounds later I was happier fat and sane than skinny and insane. It stabilized my mood, eased the delusions, started the brain chemistry back on track and allowed me to think again.  I had brain fog.  I moved onto Invega a second generation of Risperdal from what I was told with far less side effects.  I'm glad I was not on it very long.  As far as antipsychotics go, one must be aware of the potency and how strong they can be as far as side effects. Please take precautions ie avoid heating up as I did not realize how I could suddenly heat my core and hit the ground.  But  you can take other drugs for the ticks and it really worked on the psychosis for me. I toughened up on this drug. It made many I went onto the past six years seem tame... Relativity... and sanity. It did work. It hurt and I got fat but I got better.

Is there any way I can stop the psychiatrist from giving me the injections.  I am completely normal for the last so many years and I don't know how the medication can be stopped once it is started.  The psychiatrist has said that I must take it all my life.  It is very expensive to take this medication all your life and is a drain on my resources.  Among the side effects are weakening of the muscles of the eye (I am not able to open my eyelids when i get up in the morning).  doctor refuses to stop the injections.  Even my calf muscles seem to have weakened and I fear that my heart muscles and other muscles in my body may have weakened also due to this strong injection that I have been taking for so many years now.  I have also put on weight due to the medication but psychiatrist is not attributing it to the injection and continues to treat me wiht it because he thinks the more expensive the drug, the better it is.  I would like to know what will make the psychiatrist stop the medication all together.

I was non-compliant on oral meds, and in the hospital more than I was out because of my symptoms.  It took a while for my moods to regulate, but eventually,it worked better than anything else. I have not had an episode in three years, nor, of course, been hospitalized.  It helps me because it takes away my ability to be non-compliant, because I do it in a doctors office, and because it is only every two weeks.

I then spent the next to years constantly increasing testosterone (which is very had to get and keep getting, but Viagra, that's super easy despite not a single symptom Viagra treats) sexual side effects became a huge problem but no American resource mentions a thing. I asked my doctor, and said problems started on lithium, and got worse with Risperdal and my testosterone was dropping like a rock. My ""doctor"" then told me it wasn't the drugs, increased BOTH, then proceeded to test each and every one of the hormones Risperdal effects. she said prolactin was high but nothing to worry about. The depression from not being able to preform was devastating, and if I had known this was the cause, I would probably not been. * years of Risperdal and lithium later, Risperdal became very unstable very quick. I got a new doctor, and he took me of both and prescribed Limital, and told me What Risperdal does. I spent two months in Hell, coming off these drugs and flooded with emotions.

I think for a lot of people the reason it works is that it inflicts pain and when you're focused on the pain you can't argue or defend yourself.  The thing is, this medicine did nothing to remove or reduce hallucinations or delusions, I was having them when i had them regardless of dose (I've taken anywhere from 1-6mg/day), I was just busy focusing on the pain so didn't complain as much about the other symptoms.

I also have general anxiety disorder and mood disorder and stress because of everything going on in my life right now. I started out on 1 mg and am now on 4. When I was on 3mg I was having really, really bad thoughts and had a really scary time that scared both my parents and me. I think it had a lot to do with the fact that I had a really serious disease where I've lost two jobs in the past 3 years, have had to move back in with them to take care of me, am going to have to get all new doctors, including a new specialist in my disease at the beginning of next year, and get new insurance so some medications I'm on now I will have to get on new ones or have quanity limits. Since they have upped my dose to 4 mgs, I'm not thrilled, but I'm much more able to deal with things and maintain control of myself and at least look at solutions instead of being just so upset I couldn't even do anything but freak out about everything going around.

I was also prescribed Paxil and Klonopin too, for anxiety. My disorganized, paranoid thoughts pretty much disappeared! OCD was way better too. Then, after about 3.5 years of treatment with Risperdal, I developed a severe bladder problem, in which I had no control over my bladder. I wet the bed every single night. It really was a huge disruption in my life. This is when my Medicaid plan went to a generic(However, I'm not so sure the generic was the problem). One thing was, on the name brand, I did extremely well! As soon as I went to the generic, my bladder, and my mental state sunk again! I do not know if this has anything to do with the brand vs. generic though. However, I recently stopped taking Risperidone, and I am not at all wetting the bed anymore! Itching ceased as well. Also, Risperidone made my feel the inner restlessness(Akathesia) where I would go nuts upon taking it. Good effectiveness, horrible, nasty, side effects!!! Nearly impossible to take for me, anyway. Try to, maybe even ask for an older antipsychotic, Typical type. This stuff worked well and then turned me into a bed wetting maniac, all hopped up, all day long!

274$Condition: Bipolar I Disorder with Most Recent Episode Mixed$3/20/2015 2:59:19 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$This medication is the one that worked best for me. I have had bipolar episodes for years. Just recently, I began experiencing somatic symptoms and severe panic attacks. The Risperdal helped me control the unwanted thoughts that I had a terminal illness, helped ease the somatic symptoms I am experiencing (somatic meaning unwanted feelings such as tingiling in head, twitching, head rushes, and so forth). Everything I have is contributed to mania. The Risperdal helped ease all of these horrible symptoms almost immediately and is starting to help me get my life back and improve my overall quality of life. I was so scared by these unwanted health concerns and feelings that I almost went mad and had no pleasure or enjoyment in anything. I would just worry something was horrifically wrong with me. I do still get the night attacks right before falling asleep but it is getting much better. I have experienced some minor side effects: muscle stiffness, increased reflexes, which may still contribute to my somatic disorder but they can be side effects (minor) from Risperdal. Do expect to gain some weight and be extremely tired but the tiredness does pass once you let the Risperdal work its way into your system and do its job. Please do read all of the side effects as all medications work differently on different people. If you have dementia or have QT syndrome or any other heart problem DO NOT take this medication. All I can advise is just tell your doctor your history of medical problems, like all medications, be careful. For myself, Risperdal has saved my mental well being and has drastically improved my quality of life and happiness.

280$Condition: Other$10/25/2014 3:40:07 PM$Reviewer: 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Caregiver) $1$1$1$This medication was given to my mother after my sister moved in with her with her adult son, one that my mother did not want in her home because he had stolen from her. When she could not get him out of her home she began showing severe anger about it and she and my sister were fighting about it everyday. My sister took her to a doctor that specialized in dementia but instead of telling the truth why my mother's anger and behavior was so out of control, this doctor, who had never seen or treated my mother before,prescribed this medication. This medicine completely changed my mother from an active person to a bedridden person that had to be taken care of like a baby. She refused or wasn't able to function as a normal person. When another sister and I got involved and learned of the medicine she was being given we told my sister to stop giving it to her, which she did and my mother returned to her old self but with the same problems, the anger over my nephew living in her home, so the arguments started again and my sister, to keep my mother in a vegatated state put her back on it and that was the beginning of the end of my mother's life. My sister and I tried getting guardianship over my mother but with all the red tape and lack of money to fight it in court we had to give it up. So after a time it took its toll and only months after giving up the fight for guardianship my mother passed away and I know this medication and my sister is what caused her death!!!

Currently on Effexor SR with some relief.  My doctor added Risperdal to help.  I felt absolutely WONDERFUL...I felt like my old self emotionally.  My husband even noticed the change because I had more energy, bounce in my step. It also lessened my anxiety. Unfortunately, I developed breast milk within 2 days of starting the medication, my breast doubled in size, was constantly hungry (gained five lbs within a week), and developed very embarrassing drooling.  I went off the medication and the side effects stopped.  But I'm back to how I was before I started taking this.  I truly wish I could have tolerated the side effects.

He started on .5 mg twice a day and within 3 weeks it had kicked in. He was very sedated and his appetite had increased within the first few weeks, but 7 mths on what a different person.! He hasnt once been anxious, there have been no incidents with him, what a turnaround.? However, after the 7 mths of being on this medication he has taken a dip where many of his traits have returned, he is displaying the things he used to do before taking respiridone and the anxiety is back, i actually thought he had become resistant to it as he was being violent again. The doctor said this can happen whilst on this medication so it has been increased to 4mg a day its only been a week since hes been on the increased dose and the sedation has returned with lack of interest with activities, he sometimes looks a little vacant and delays in doing things or answering you, i do believe in repiridone though as it worked for my son for 7 mths.

Further I have made great strides to improve my physique and will not watch this 'wonder drug' slow my metabolism so I can gain excess weight.  I am not sure if this medication is intended for anyone aside from infants who cry too much.

My wife and daughter had noticed a scary change in my personality once I left the intensive care/ hospital stay and was at the rehab center. Upon checking she found out the attending doctor was prescribing Risperdal and decided to research it on the web. She was shocked and scared to find her results and immediately went to see the doctor telling him she wanted her husband off of this medication. The doctor refused until she said I was a member of AA and had a strong background in abuse of chemicals ( alcohol) 20 years before. He told her he took me off of it but she found the papers recently stating he never had during my two week stay. I believe this horrible drug caused psychosis in me while I was there and also was the culprit for my loss of taste and smell. I do remember being able to taste food when I first got to the hospital but never again after that. It is in my opinion the wrong drug to give to a patient with a serious head injury as they are already fighting to deal with brain issues. This was 13 years ago and I have never recovered my sense of smell or taste.

The only problem that I seem to be having is that my emotions are so much stronger than they have been in many years.  I do not know if this is a side effect or if it is due to the fact that I have hardly felt any emotions at all in so many years.  I actually have strong feelings of sadness and happiness (and I even smile or laugh on occasion now)but I am also having a lot of anger issues since about a week after starting the medication.  At first I thought that the anger I was feeling was situational but as I continue to take it the anger is getting out of control to the point that if something falls off of my computer stand or I have difficulties doing an easy task, I will actually cuss out loud which is something I have not done in many years.  I did, however, go from eating next to nothing to having a healthy appetite and maybe at times eating a bit too much.  My anger issues are the biggest problem I am having since being on this medication and I have tried many coping strategies in order to deal with it.  I was hoping that by posting my experience on WebMD that I could possibly find out if any other people have had anger issues while taking Risperidone.  I would greatly appreciate any and all suggestions to make this issue go away.  If you do have any ideas that could possibly help then please e-mail me at [email protected] as I hardly ever go on the WebMD site.

I first thought, and even now, is that it works well for my symptoms. The thing that happened to me was that I always had a high prolactin level. My periods started to slowly disappear. I would have it one month then not have it for 3. I was only 24 when I started. Then eventually my periods went away for 4 and a half years. I was thrilled that the medication was making me not menstruate since I didnt want anymore children. But after 4 and a half years without a period, abnormal cells began to grow in the uterus. I ended up having endometrial cancer, (uterine cancer) from the mix of hormones that the drug was giving me. After my radical hysterectomy  I went into menopause at 32 years old. Even now, after almost a year after surgery I still am leaking breast milk from the medication. I believe that if you are a woman on this drug, watch your hormones and periods carefully.

She has been physically healthy and on eyedrops only. I feel since it is not recommended for elderly dementia and has life threatening side effects, that she should not be given this medication.  She was walking before this medication but now is unable to without falling.  Her aggression is only during these times and I feel that it is because she is confused and afraid.  It ceases when the intervention is complete.  There is no psychiatrist ordering this medication or appropriate blood work monitoring.

At first when I took this medication I was hospitalized for drug induced psychosis. I was extremely deluded, spoke in word salads, extremely paranoid.  My brain twisted words spoken by people into words of extremely negative and harsh words constantly criticizing me and that made me depressed, angry and violent.  I wouldn't hear voices without people talking; like if I went to a quiet place I wouldn't hear any voices.

[Effects]

When I first started this medicine I was like a zombie-still am-and it affected my cognitive ability to the point that I had to relearn certain things.  During the first week of taking the medicine I would have frequent panic attacks in which my breathing would be strange and I had difficulty swallowing my saliva.  I had never had panic attacks before taking this medication. Risperdal seemed to shift my anxiety and fear from social phobia into panic attacks.

[Conclusion]

Apart from the side-effects of being: a zombie, impaired cognitive ability, weight gain, bigger chest fat around nipples(wtf), sensitivity to temperature, inhibited my speech to the point people think I'm autistic maybe due the drug's blocking of the serotonin receptor; I would say this drug has helped me blend back into society and has given me an opportunity to go to school and pursue a career at the same time.

tips

Exercise of 30 min per day helps, living with a caring family helps, socializing with friends that don't drink, do drugs or do criminal or dangerous activities helps too. Going back to school or getting a job helps as well. Good luck."

con: i gained weight, lactated, laziness, i did not really have a motive for anything. the worst thing about this drug though, was the fact that i felt like i had no feeling, coming from before being anxious and having too many thoughts and fears to having any makes you seem lifeless, it was good for overcoming my extremely bad anxiety, but once i got off the medication i got anxiety, it has however gone down."

All I desired was to see my ex stable for once in her life and I allowed myself to be talked into seeking help for myself, (hoping to set an example), when it was her who desperately needed it. The psychiatrist believed the stories fabricated by my ex and treated me with Risperdal. This drug is dangerous when it is not needed. I hallucinated, drooled, had high and low mood swings, heart palpitations, etc. and it made me feel so high, then low, that I literally wanted to kill myself. At times I felt so high, I felt invincible. I had the sense to realize that something was dangerously wrong here. Having the sense to stop the medication shortly after starting it, (within a couple of months), because of the dangerous side effects I was feeling, what was most unbelievable even to this day, was the idea that another human being, (the psychiatrist), could use someone like a guinea pig and drug them into oblivion while under their care. Thank God I am 6 years out of this predicament but the emotional triggers that were inserted into me while in the hospital are as real as if they happened yesterday. Every day is a struggle to maintain my perspective and realization that when medical mistakes are made and not acknowledged, people can die. Had I did decide to take my life while drugged, the psychiatrist would have been validated and I would have been considered the nut. Psychiatry is a dangerous business. I have not only reported this to MedWatch but also to my local, State of CT Practicioner's Licensing and Investigations Board, The Attorney General, as well as other authorities, all to no avail. I do not wish what happened to me on anyone. All the systems do is protect each other at all costs. This is immoral.

357$Condition: Other$3/29/2012 2:36:16 AM$Reviewer: Lisa, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $4$4$5$After suffering from depression since childhood and taking nearly all brands of antidepressants, which were not effective, I was diagnosed with chronic major depression. Initially the psychiatrist put me on Olanzapine, which helped with the depression, but the major side effects of this drug were weight gain of 60 lbs. in six months and sleeping 14-16 hours per day.  Now that I am on .5mg of Risperdal my life has changed.  My mood has improved immensely, though my anxiety has increased slightly. I have lost 20 lbs. in 4 months.  However, my hypersomnia has turned into insomnia, but at least I am able to get things done.  Other adverse effects are confusion, inability to concentrate and bladder problems.  As I was able to retire early, some of these side effects will not destroy my life as the depression did, though I would not recommend this drug to someone with depression who is under 50 or over 70 unless many other alternatives have been tested.  Everyone reacts differently to medication, but my recommendation would be to start at the very minimum dosage and slowly work your way up if need be to avoid serious side effects as much as possible. My major concern with this drug are the long-term side effects.

I had a twitch in my lip that wouldn't not go away. I told me doctor and she had me stop taking the risperdal and told me to start taking seroquel which I did not. I had UNBELIEVABLE side effects I stopped eating, started smoking again and would not leave my home or drive my car, my personality completely changed to a fun-loving person to some kind of mental case.   I was super paranoid and had unreal panic attacks.  Finally it all ended with a seizure (never had one in my life or history of seizures in my family)that put me on deaths door step. My daugther found me on my kitchen floor she thought I was dead. I fractured my right shoulder from the fall that had to be completely replace and I need additional surgery.  I was hospitalized from 10/29/11 to 12/31/11 and was in a rehab because my right side had also become paralyzed.  I believe with my whole heart and soul that risperdal did this to me.  I am now on 10 different pills including Keppra,seroquel, a multitude of vitamins, high blood pressure meds, pain meds and klonapin.  I was 45 minutes away from death..I have my ex-doctor to thank for this life changing experience and risperdal.  Be careful when taking this medication and never, ever just stop taking it you have to be weened...

Instead of teaching me to be more assertive, let's just make the emotions go away, right??

Well anyway.  On 1-2 mg, I slept constantly, had such pain in my hips, shoulders, and pectoral muscles that I could not walk or lift my kids, and could not think clearly enough to do simple household chores without someone to remind me of each step.  

I had all the negative emotions-- in fact my depression worsened until I became suicidal-- but my therapists thought everything was great because I appeared calm due to having no ability to think clearly enough to express what I was feeling.  

All in all a horrible drug.  Unless someone is very violent, I would not even consider Risperdal for treatment.  "

Recently, I read up online and found out that Risperdal can affect hormones, menstrual cycles, and brain tissue. I have galactorea (breast milk) from it, my hair has almost ceased growing on my body, and the hair on my head is thinner. When I started taking Risperdal I was 130 lbs., now I'm 220; and if anything my eating has gotten better. It makes me hungry. I have been taking birth control for 5 years, and nothing's ever been different.. but now that I've been on Risperdal for 2ish years, it has significantly slowed down. I take Effexor XR for depression/panic attacks, Lithium/mood stabilizer, and Risperdal for anger and manic episodes. I have tried Geodon, Abilify, Saphris, & many others. None of them have been as effective as Risperdal, but the side effects of it are killer. I am going to try Latuda and Saphris again because I didn't truly give Saphris a chance. Good luck

My tongue, head, neck, arms and legs were moving involuntarily. I had had two inch long blood filled places on my legs, similar, but smaller sores in my mouth. I couldn't be understood when I spoke and had a rapid heart rate.  I ended up in the ER.  They gave me something to calm my muscles down and told me I should be back to normal withing 24-48 hours.  I saw my own Psychiatrist the following day; he told me it would be longer as my pupils were still huge.  19 days I suffered with those side effects before they wore off.  My doctor was ticked that it was even prescribed for me, as it is an older drug, not used as much for bipolars because there are others that work better with fewer side effects.  I now have it listed as a drug I am allergic to.  I wouldn't recommend anyone take this without trying everything else first!

A few months after this drug was added, I began experiencing vision problems, and, after seeing my eye doctor, was referred to a neurologist ophthalmologist who diagnosed me with Nystagmus in both my eyes, which is a ticking of the eye, much like a pendulum on a clock.  With the help of the drug, Lamictal, the nystagmus is controlled in my front and right vision, but not when I look to my left.  This problem occurred over a year ago, and it appears to be permanent.  This is a horrible drug -- I would not recommend anyone taking it.

When I dropped it cold turkey I lost thirty pounds within three to four months. After a two week detox period I could sleep normally and was not irritable. It's been a year and a half since I last took and haven't looked back. I used along with risperdal the generic prozac: fluoxetine.

I started this around Thanksgiving and at 1st it worked well towards my aggressive feelings towards my hard to get a long with mother in law, but needed to have the 4 mg. dose lowered due to feeling just BLAAAAA. No feelings whatsoever towards her or doing anything. Then that feeling soon changed and we upped the dose back to the original prescription again because the blaas went away and I didn't want to feel aggressive again as I'm not normally an aggressive person whatsoever, not ever. Then I started feeling anxious all the time from it,like on speed. As soon as I was taken off of it the other day and put on Seroquel, I could feel an almost instant change and a lot more mellow now. I HATE IT. It also gave me the 'munchies' all the time, which is bad because I had bariatric surgery back in 2006. I've been blessed so far in that Seroquel, so far, hasn't done this yet.

I started to see his hand curling at the wrist and he started to hold his hands and arms curled up to his head. I was totally freaked out! He is non-verbal so he could never tell me what he was feeling. It turns out he was having a side effect called Tardive Dyskinesia. It is a serious condition and can become permanent.

The doctors did not take time to review my symptoms when I was admitted, so I was put on the drug almost immediately after admittance.
As it turned out, I had severe OCD and moderate mood issues, NOT schizophrenia as they had thought.
After being put on another medication, the Risperdal was STILL not working.
2 years later, I started going to a different psychiatrist, and he FINALLY got me off the drug.
The problem was now, not my condition, but my weight. I had always been underweight, but during the 2005-2006 school year, I nearly doubled my weight, going from 65lbs to 120.
I was bullied because of my weight, and eventually it got so bad that I was homeschooled from late 2006-mid 2009.
5 years later, I am a freshman (back in the public school system) and still have not recovered from the side affects of Risperdal,I am now almost 140 lbs.
This drug did not work for me, and (even if they did have schizophrenia) I wouldn't wish this medication on ANYONE, even my worst enemy."

I have always had times where I have, you could say, went crazy.  I have had extreme highs and extreme lows.  In a rage I stuck a steak knife in my chest twice.  Then was hospitalized.  There they put me on this medication.  At first I thought it was helping wonderfully.  After about 6 months I began to hate myself on it.  I never had any emotion.  No happiness, no sadness, and no anger.  All are vital to being a human being, as long as none are extreme.  I decided to quit cold turkey.  Did not take long till I was losing my mind, literally.  At the time I had no idea why, I just thought I must really be crazy and need this medicine.  Then I would take it again.  Then of course quit.  I spent another 6 months trying to live a normal life.  I don't remember most of this time.  It is time I will never get back.  I just know that if ever I really wanted to die it was this time.  My brain was screaming at me daily, hourly, minutely, and every second.  No one including doctors understood what was wrong with me.  It was a nitemare.  To put anyone through any of this is horrible.  To be on it was horrible.  The dreams, the no emotion, the not wanting to live.  Still every show that I watched when I was on this, when they come on I get the most horrific feeling when they come on.  The side effects to using this will never, I do believe, completely go away.  I would rather be dead than be on this.  That is coming from the heart.  Please make sure you or your loved one is in dyer need of this before taking.  It will ruin yours and those around you's life.

Risperdal is the only one that worked to relieve my bipolar mania symptoms, namely hearing voices, being paranoid and having anxiety all the time. The only downside is I gained over 60 pounds. I was already obese to begin with so gaining so much weigh has just put a huge burden on me. Also I have trouble losing weight but I'm not sure that it's the Risperdal that is causing it. Oh, I finally ended up on 6mg. That's a relatively high dose for someone with bipolar but I do have a severe form of it.

In that time she went from a size 5 to a size 10 in clothing. She weighed 43 lbs before starting and currently is 56lbs. I keep her eating under control and always feed her healthy food. She cries because she is always hungry. I had to buy her size 10 pants and hem the legs 6 inches just so she can wear jeans. I am doing all I can to stop her from scratching her skin because she is getting stretch-marks. I cannot even lift her anymore she is so heavy. The bad part is, she is still gaining weight. She also has had an increase in Absence seizures as well. She is taking Lamictal for seizures, but it isn't working. The only reason she takes risperdal it is because the school cannot stand my child's manic behavior. My advise is to think what is more important, satisfying lazy teachers or putting your child through physical horror. I feel terrible about her being on this med. I wish there was a safer alternative for small children.

I empathize with you wanting to end your child's suffering, as well as having a child that is 'easier' to deal with...but once you start a child on a life of 'popping pills' to cope...you are going down a very slippery slope. A child will learn very quickly they are now perceived as 'different' and labels can fast become self-fulfilling prophecies. Please please please parents, I am not writing this out of arrogance or indifference...I am writing this out of compassion, empathy and love...all I ask is that you take a deep breath, do some homework, even get a second opinion before you start jumping on the 'pill band wagon'. Sometimes these medications seem like 'wonder drugs'...but they can also make for short term gain and long term pain. If I reach just one person with my statement here, I will have made a positive difference in the live(s) of someone already struggling and dealing with hurt, suffering and pain. Bless each and everyone of you trying to do the best you can with little or no experience dealing with mental health (a continued 'taboo' issue even in the 21st century). As I said, I write this not out of malice, but from my heart as someone who has endured the stigma of mental illness plus experienced adverse life-threatening side effects to psychotropic drugs during my adolescence!! I want to prevent further unnecessary suffering!

It has helped so much!  Her behaviors are better.  She's starting to settle down enough to learn.  The doctor suggested she may also need a stimulant and I agree, but after such a rough start on the drug (lasted about 4 days) my 5-year-old is also grateful for it.  She does have an increased appetite but will gladly eat fruit when wanting to snack so she's only gained a pound.

Seeing no major differece, so we thought, we took him off after starting Kindergarten at age 6.  Mistake.  Within two months he was uncontrollable and worse than before.  He was suspended from Kindergarten for pulling out a peer's hair and deemed ""a threat to himself and others"".  We sought support at Children's Hospital immediately that day and put him back on it, increasing to .5mg/2x daily.  His performance, attention and social skills improved at school.  He has experienced no weight gain but does have a lack of energy.  Recently, due to a new escalation, he is up to .5mg/3x's daily and is in therapy.  He turns seven in a month.  We aren't where we want to be, but Risperdal certainly put us in the right direction.  Although too young to officially diagnose, he is being treated as early onset bipolar.  We also added Trazodone to his regime to help the nightmares and inability to sleep.  I regret fighting the medicinal route for him and encourage parents to hear out your pediatrician or psychiatrist before deciding AGAINST use of this medicine.

I am spiritually inclined, and my doctor was an Atheist. He made it very 'clear' to me that angels and god were fabrications, and false clutches, and there is no proof that my beliefs could be real. He also stated that imagination and faith are not healthy 'choices' in this world. I was suicidal at the time due to non-faith based problems, but pressures and events at that time of my life that built up to severe depression. But, he used his prejudice to diagnose me and ignored the real reasons I was in danger. I needed help for the events that happened to me, not medication for *one* sentence I uttered about prayer.  It sounds like a made-up story, I assure you it was not. This is an issue I have with the sector of psychology that assumes God is a mental illness. I am a colorful creative person, and he used his gray-stoicism to counter my beliefs, rather than help me. If you are indeed, schizophrenic or have dementia, this pill will work, since my great aunt took it for her dementia, and it helped. But if you are diagnosed WRONGLY this will make you even more depressed, despondent, zombie like, and coupled with prozac, I gained 55 lbs. I had a trainer and was on a diet, and still didn't lose the weight, which made me MORE depressed. It wasn't until I went to a new doctor 2 1/2 years later, that I was avenged. She saved me, told me I was GROSSLY misdiagnosed, and dangerously over-medicated. 
(he had me at full dose Prozac and 90% full dose Resp.) Nightmare. 

PLEASE PEOPLE. GET SECOND OPNIONS. It could save your life!! You are never 'married' to any doctor, regardless if they make you feel like they're the only one you should see. LEAVE THEM if you are doing everything correctly, and still are getting no results months later. "
509$Condition: Bipolar Depression$8/7/2009 6:43:55 PM$Reviewer: 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$3$I was diagnosed with Bi-polar and prescribed this drug. However, after stopping this drug, I have seen many doctors and all of them tell me it was a misdiagnoses because I do not have Bi-polar. However, while on this pill I gained over 100 pounds in less than six months (I was a size zero and now I am lucky to fit into a size 16). I can't say how well it helped my disorder since I did not have any disorder which would be treated by this drug. However, I can say, that it did affect my appetite and I was always hungry I did not eat much more than before, but I always wanted to and even without changing my diet I still more than doubled my weight. Now I have depression because of the side effects of this drug. While weight gain may not happen to everyone, talk to your doctor about other options especially if it is for a child who is under 18 since this drug effects weight in some people this could cause problems in mental and psychical health of children. If you have children who have doctors who are telling them to take it, I strongly recommend not doing so. I was  in high school while on this drug and I was made fun of daily for being fat which is all the worse when it was due to side effects of a drug. (I have been off this drug for three years and only lost 30 pounds so far so the side effects don't end when you are taken of this drug).

At the time, it did help with disruptive behavior but mostly because it caused fatigue. My son gained almost 40 pounds, had breasts beginning to develop, and abnormal liver function tests. Whenever he was 16, last year, he suddenly developed abnormal liver enzymes which couldn't be attributed to anything else- every test short of biopsy was performed. And suddenly he started to gain weight- so much that he now has severe stretch marks. All of this happened 8 years after stopping the risperdal and returning to his pre-risperdal weight. I am very concerned about what even psychiatrists such as my son's previous pediatric psychiatrist are giving to kids. He is functioning much better on nothing but behavior modifications. He just graduated at 17 and made a 25 on the ACT. I'm just not sure of the long=term effects on children and I don't think anyone in the medical community truly is either.

My doctor confirmed I was not but asked me to trust his decision. I'm glad I did and wish I had taken this medication a long time ago. Initially there was some side effects of anxiety but was told to take benydryl to counteract it, which it did. It only lasted the first few days. My outlook is much different, my abnormal anger has subsided. I still get mad but its a normal emotion in response to normal situtations. I sleep through the night, I feel rested and not overly tired anymore, in fact I have more energy. I feel at peace and my family no longer has to walk on tiptoes around me. That is what I am most grateful for because as miserable as I felt, my family suffered more. I have had no wieght gain other than my normal fluctuations, I am geneticly large to begin. This medication has given me a new life.

It helped organize my thoughts, made me feel ""less undone."" It also cause me to *lactate.* That's right. I was told it was a rare side effect. However, upon reviewing these other reviews, I found another instance in less than 5 minutes, so I doubt that it's rare. This is a classic case of the cure being worse than the disease. I'm absolutely disgusted by the lack of proper information and the general lax response I received from the doctor who prescribed it. Something seriously disturbing is going on in the body for drug to make a non-pregnant woman to lactate. The only upside is that it has made me swear off psych medication. I am not a guinea pig. Further investigation should be done on this drug, esp. in light of kick-backs and extreme side-effects.  "

Attempted suicide 3 times.  In general this drug calms her down and help her sleep, she takes 1 mg/daily at night with prozac 10mg.  However, after a period of 4~5 months she'd start to complain of the side effects such as weight gain, short term memory loss, high blood sugar...etc and will begin to refuse the drug.  In the past my father and I have complied with her and let her skip the doses, and shortly after she'd relapse.  She's in one of those phase now, refusing the drug again complaining that she can't even remember when my sister got married (just recently).  We had to talk to her for an hr last night to get her take it.  We know this drug carry harmful side effects, but the consequence of not taking is too grave.  I really hope there are better drugs out there that'd help my mother, but right now Risperdal is all we have that helps.

He started this medicine and within 2 days he was amazingly better.  He is almost 7 and is on .5 mg twice per day.  If we skip a dose, it's obvious, as he's angry and irritable again.  When he's on it without missing a dose he is happy, loving, appropriately energetic, sleeps through the night.  He still has a full range of emotions and is very caring and loving and social.  It has made a tremendous difference to our family as things had gotten very bad and he had even talked about leaving the family and suicide a couple of times.  He was on a higher dose (just .5 mg more) and he started having trouble swallowing, so I took him off it for a week while we decided what to do.  All his psychological symptoms cam back within 2 days... His psychiatrist wants him to stay on it but I'm vigilant for any swallowing issues and I will give him Benedryl at the first sign of anything.  He has oral dyspraxia also so he already had difficultly with swallowing and breath control/cooridination, so it's hard to say if it's the Risperdal or not.  He has gained weight, 8 pounds so far, but we are trying to develop better eating habits!

My first reaction to the diagnosis was that the doctor was crazy, not me, but it fit. My many, many nervous habits, motor ticks and even vocal ticks that I hadn't noticed, were all characteristics of Tourette's. The doctor started me on Risperdal, which I've been on for about two weeks now, and so far I've been really impressed by it. I take 1 mg at night, which allows me to sleep a full 8 hours!!! I also take 1/4 to 1/2 mg as needed throughout the day for anxiety, and I notice a difference in less than half an hour. Along with Zoloft and Wellbutrin, it’s worked great so far.

Thank God for the Risperdal. He rarely even gets angry anymore, and I'm no longer afraid to confront him if he's behaved negatively. However, the weight gain has been enormous. He's grown a lot height wise, but the weight gain isn't in proportion. He's an athlete, lifts weights 5 days a week and works out with his track team every day. The problem is he's now 300 pounds, at 6'5"", and he gained so much weight so fast he even has stretch marks on his waist, hips, under his arms, his shoulders, etc. His size is great for football, to a certain degree but not so much for basketball, as the extra weight really slows him down. He eats healthy, but enormous amounts of food. If not for the weight gain, this would be the perfect medication for him. Kids have started teasing him, even though he's a popular athlete at his high school. His success in school can only be attributed to being on Risperdal. We've had to gauge what's more important here, and since he was basically headed for a life of crime and juvenile detention centers followed most likely by life in adult prisons, we'll take the weight gain.

Risperdal was given to me at the onset of my illness, which was drug induced.  Although many people find Risperdal to be an efficacious drug, I found it very difficult to tolerate.  Perhaps it was because I was new to the whole schizophrenia thing, but I have had much better luck on Zyprexa (which is the best anti-psychotic on the market; it just has terrible side effects) and Abilify.  Risperdal made me emotionally numb; it detached me from myself and my experiences.  Additionally, it (like most of the anti-psychotics to some degree) caused me to gain some weight.  Overall, I would consider talking to your physician (and doing your own research) before starting Risperdal.  I think that you may find more pleasant alternatives, such as Abilify.  However, tolerance of anti-psychotic drugs is a very subjective experience, so Risperdal may be right for you.  But it was certainly not right for me.

I knew she had it, after documenting her episodes for 2 years.  Her biological mother has it, her grandmother has it and her uncle has it.  She was EXTREMELY irritable and MOODY all the TIME!  
Since prescribed Risperdol of 5mg in the AM and 5mg at night before she goes to bed, she has developed into a 6yr girl that I can reason with at any time of the day and she is now the ""delightful"" little girl we hoped to have! 
What a miracle medicine!

While it has helped with his aggression (this is a boy who at age 2 stabbed his father with a knife and at age 3 attempted to suffocate his newborn brother with a pillow) we are still not seeing a complete turn around in him. I am a parent adversive to medicating my children but felt in this instance it was the best course of action. The small dosage is why he maintains an aggressive talk therapy regime from many angles (not only a psychologist and psychiatrist but also with school counselors, church pastors, etc). So far we have seen a weight gain but cannot rule out this was not genetically based as I did the same at his age. No other side effects have been present.

Overall, she bahavior is stable, sleeping well, and bedwetting has not returned. No weight gain to report. The downside is at times she seems ""out of it"" just staring into space. Her ability to focus is also reduced. Now that puberty has set in and after a recent growth spurt we are showing experiencing symptoms again. One downside is that the doctors do not (or are not willing) to increase the dosage as a child grows because the pills are only offered in certain increments. Until she grows more, quite a bit more, we will have to deal with the issues until the medication can be increased. "

I have looked up on the internet some side effects because I haven't been feeling well lately and noticed that I am experiencing quite a few of the side effects of risperdal. I am especially disgusted with my weight gain since I was always a size 10. I am 58 years old. I work full time but I am most of the time very tired. Three years ago I had my thyroid out and gained even more weight. I thought maybe I wasn't getting the right dosage of synthroid but my doctor did extensive blood work and could not find anything medically wrong with me. I am pretty sure that I am suffering from the side effects of the risperdal. I believe I had a brief psychotic disorder which brought on hallucinations when my husband ran off with my girlfried 15 years ago. My world had crashed and I was faced with keeping my house and had trouble keeping a job. So I was constantly faced with the possibility of losing my house under constant stress. My life is much better now. I am engaged and my 2 brothers live with me to help me financially with the house. I am wondering if I need this risperdal now. The side effects seem worse to me now.

I was hospitalized in March 2010 and placed on resperdal 2mg at bedtime.  I am careful about my weight as I take other medications that cause fluctuations.  Until today (12/5/10) I was unaware this medication caused weight gain.  In the last 4 months I've gained over 20 lbs even though I've been trying to control my weight.  I'm heavier than I've ever been and I also suffer from Fibromyalgia and am small framed.  My body can't take the extra weight as its too hard on my joints.

Risperdal is one of the medications that he takes and he has worked for 2 years now, but I am now seeing that he is protraying alot of aggressive behaviors, perfanity and is very irratible after he is administered the medication and my son is only 11 years old.  He still acts aggresively even if he doesn't take it and he's never been so disruptive in this manner before.  I do not recommend anyone taking this for an extended period of time if you are taking other medications as well.
