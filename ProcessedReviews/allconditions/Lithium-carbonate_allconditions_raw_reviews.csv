1$Condition: Other$3/17/2012 2:35:22 PM$Reviewer: $1$1$1$Do not ingest this toxic substance if you want to have a good life. Lithium is a non-essential alkali metal, meaning it has no actual biological function in the human body. It can interfere with potassium and sodium which are essential metals that are involved in nerve communication. Lithium completely destroys the renal (kidney) system and many long term lithium users die prematurely from kidney issues due to lithium. Lithium also interferes with thyroid function. Thyroid hormones are critical to the proper functioning of the human metabolism as well as the nervous system. Lithium also interferes with a number of other bodily functions like hormone and enzyme production. In clinical studies lithium has also been proven to prevent the female estrous cycle. Overall lithium is a harmful alkali metal to the human body as well as other Earthly organisms. It is not something that should be recommended to patients. I personally know someone who was harmed by the metal lithium, therefore I am committed to helping others. A substance used for decongestion and amino acid, N-acetylcysteine has been proven to somewhat lessen the effects of lithium induced renal dysfunction (if the lithium is discontinued). If anyone is currently having issues with lithium treatment, ask if your doctor will switch to N-acetylcysteine. N-acetylcysteine has also been clinically proven to lessen the effects of OCD and bipolar disorder. I sincerely hope that this information helps someone out there!

It smoothed out my daily and seasonal mood gradient. I have had low side effects. In the last 3 years my kidneys weakened, but I am still taking a low dose, 150mg daily.
The WebMD information grossly exaggerates the risk of ""serotonin syndrome."" Compared to anti-depressants, lithium has very little effect on serotonin levels. Fear of serotonin syndrome should not factor into a patient's or a doctor's decision to try lithium.   "

17$Condition: Manic-Depression$2/16/2017 11:45:07 AM$Reviewer: GGBgirl, 19-24 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I would not be alive if it wasn't for this med. I was fighting mental illness for nearly seven years since I was 13. I cut myself and would sometimes beat myself until the area turned purple and yellow.  I've attempted suicide more times than I can count in hope of succeeding, and flew 1800 miles alone to San Francisco  with no way back and nothing much other than the clothes I was wearing. My sole purpose to jump off the Golden Gate Bridge when I arrived. However, it took three more hospitalizations after that before I was started on lithium. Lamictal was added and finally Effexor. Lithium did a great job while to side was right. It did best at controlling the manic side, but I didn't have the mood swings I had before. The other meds further helped with the depression side. I don't know why lithium is not prescribed more often. It's a great medication and I don't know where I'd be without it. Sideffects seem minimal and I've been taking it for over two years now. I think it makes me more sleepy, but I think the others do as well. I have to be careful in the heat and make sure I replace electrolytes, and watch caffeen intake and be careful with ibuprofen. But it's wonderful. I know meds work differently for everyone, but if your like me and tried dozens of meds with no results, then it's definitely worth talking to your doc about it. And find a good doc. A good doc will listen and allow you to suggest things about your treatment and meds and not force you to change meds or force you take something that you don't want to. I hope this helps to all our there struggling. Don't ever give up hope. :)

He put mr on alprazolam after the valium and you CANT go from valium to alprazolam and survive. I started getting wicked withdrawals and my idiot dr prescribed me lithium along with an old AD. Why I even took them in the first place is a mystery since I never asked for these meds and even told him my sleep was great. Started feeling sick after tsking fir two days while on vacation with hitler and told my fiance (hitler) that they were making me sick and I needed to stop them. She got angry and demanded I keep taking them and I didnt want anymore silent treatment/anger...two weeks later I suffered brain, muscle, nerve and kidney damage!!! This has ruined my life and before I met my fiance I was fine. NEVER take crap from a partner and when you see red flags you run like hell!!! Also, be careful about taking meds in general...do you think depression was because a lack of prozac?! Sorry, ive read enough about big pharma, the fda and drs to know better....its all a scam. If you dont believe me thats fine but pretty soon itll be common knowledge that medication is vastly overprescribed and the clinical trials are a joke at best. Listen to me now and thank me later. Ever wonder why the listed side effects are minimal compared to actual side effects of people taking them? Well, just maybe the manufacturer(who also
 is the one testing the drugs) is kind of lying or witholding the truth?! Of course not! Why would they lie? Its not like the drug is going to make millions or billions of dollars anyways...oh wait, yes it is!

20$Condition: Bipolar Depression$8/6/2016 7:11:49 AM$Reviewer: China, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years$5$5$5$Lithium is the reason I believe I am still alive.  I had tried committing suicide three times.  I swallowed an entire bottle of tricyclics which should have killed me.  I was so desperate after medications didn't work that I was considering electroshock therapy.  On the third day of taking Lithium I could physically feel something change in my brain.  Like a switch turning on.  My crippling depression is gone as is my urge to die.  I'm not saying I don't struggle day to day but I never even contemplate hurting myself.  I know every medication works differently for different people so I am not saying run out and get it.  But if you are desperate to fight your depression it might be worth asking your doctor about it.

I first started taking this and felt great within a few days! I then started the hand trembling and then very slowly started to see a change in my vision. I noticed that I would get like quick flashes of light or one eye would go blank. I told my doctor and he removed me from it and put me on something else. I truly love this drug, but if it wasn't for these side effects, I'd be a happy camper.

I have tried numerous other medications, mainly newer ones, and they have failed to work.  I was a bit hesitant, mainly due to the weight gain and other side effects, but I am finally in control for once in my life.  No more wanting to spend money frivolously, and seek action and adventure in my life.  I finally have seen the light, and it's great to be doing better, after such a long period of struggle.  I would caution though to get regular blood tests, this drug can have some nasty side effects to the kidneys and thyroid.  Hope this helps!!!

I shudder to think what life would be like without it. Unfortunately, I'm brand-sensitive. That is, I do not respond to just any brand of the drug that my pharmacy is pushing at the moment. I only respond to Lithobid made by Sandoz. I have picked up some moderate hand trembling as the years have gone by, but other than that, I have no side effects to speak of. I literally owe my life to this drug, since like most of us, I have come to find that there are some things in life that are worse than death.

I have suffered from extreme depression since I was a child, and struggled with alcoholism and drug addiction since high school.

This is the first medication I can honestly say has changed my life. This along with the meds I was previously taking, and continuing my work in AA and NA, I feel like a new person. I, like most, did have some side effects when I first started taking it, (tremors, tiredness, weight gain and thirst) but after about a month these subsided. I feel so much better and even the people around me have noticed that I seem more alert and ""here"" as opposed to being depressed and distant. If you struggle with severe depression and are struggling to find the right meds, I strongly recommend talking to your doctor about trying lithium. "

PAY ATTENTION. lithium has side effects that you are supposed to talk to your Dr. about IMMEDIATELY. All this talk of diarrhea and tremors means you have too much in your system, need to get a level blood check immediately, etc. 

I took one pill a day for two and a half years and it all-but-cured my bipolar. I was injured in an auto accident, had my dosage monkeyed with by incompetent hospital shrinks and I went into toxicity: slurred speech, lack of sleep, muscle cramps, etc. NOW that I had too much I can't take a therapeutic dose anymore. I have struggled (depakote made my hair fall out, weight gain) and am just ok on Trileptol (oxcarbazepine) with an Abilify kicker. 
GET YOU BLOOD TESTS REGULARLY. lithium can help tremendously, if you don't take too much!!! Don't listen to the fearmongers who haven't taken the stuff. Even though I took too much, I never had any renal or thyroid issues. Just be proactive in your therapy if you really want to be healthy. READ ABOUT YOUR DRUGS. REPORT SIDE EFFECTS. CHANGE MDs IF THEY DONT LISTEN. Best of luck to you. "
43$Condition: Bipolar Depression$6/25/2014 3:37:06 PM$Reviewer: misslissa, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I took lithium for about 2 years and did very well on it. It helped regulate my moods to an 'almost normal' point, the best I've ever been. There were side effects, however. The worst side effect for me was the thirst/dehydration - and the way I dealt with it. I drank a lot of water because I was always thirsty, but this caused hyponatremia - low salt to water ratio. I would experience painful headaches, vertigo, tingling in my extremities, and more because of it. Now that I know what caused the problems, this time on lithium I will try to drink less pure water and more sports drinks for thirst, and to make sure I sneak some salty foods into my diet. I just started taking lithium again and after 24 hours I already feel so much better. I feel much less depressed and anxious, but I'm not manic either. I've experienced other side effects, too. The most annoying being the tremors in my hand. The shaking usually isn't too bad, but once one of my arms started jerking - reminiscent of a seizure but only in one arm. It lasted about 20 minutes and never recurred.

I still struggle with the depression but that's something different I'm not talking about. The main side effect I have experienced is that you DEFINITELY cannot be in the sun for an extended amount of time. I miss 2 or more doses and I start getting really bad with my anger and crying...but everyone suffers some normally. I would definitely recommend this drug :)

My memory, balance and coordination are not the same. I am now applying for disability because I cannot perform at work. DO NOT take unless nothing else has worked for you.

I also take Klonopin for anxiety and Effexor for deppression.  This drug ""cocktail"" works perfect for me and stops the destructive BiPolar Mania/Depression and.  The side effects were initially weight gain and sleepiness.  The doctor adjusted does of each med to eliminate those side effects.  300mg. lithium 3 times daily; 150mg effexor twice daily and 1mg Klonopin 3 times daily work fine for me.  Lithium and Klonopin (a benzodiazipine) (or other bezodizepine) are considered the ""gold standard"" for BiPolar IorII since 1950.  Many drs. don't like benzodiazipines because of their potential for abuse and addiction, but the fact is they work and the doctor can do a lot to prevent abuse and addiction of any drug by closely monitoring the patient.  Based on my 20 year success with Lithium, anti-depressant (Effexor) and anti-anxiety agent ( Klonipin or clonazepam),  I highly suggest a trial of these drugs."

57$Condition: Bipolar Disorder in Remission$1/29/2014 7:38:36 AM$Reviewer: Ferris1, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$Having been one of the first to be given lithium (LiCO3) in 1970 in AZ, it works wonders and it is a mineral NOT a pharmaceutical recipe. The dosage has to be decreased when tremors and diarrhea start and the psychiatrist has to not stick to the blood level charts and listen to the patient's side effects. Get the thyroid checked 1 or 2 times per year. Yes, there is a metal taste in my mouth, but having moodswings is no picnic. It destroys relationships, can ruin you financially, and put you in jail (I've been there). But, with lithium I now have three college degrees, been married for 30 yrs. and am not depressed nor hypomanic or manic. This mineral is the GOLD standard for bipolar disorder. It also is used to treat migraines which I also have. I do not take anything else because lithium keeps me stable and able to care for my dementia husband. I have to be well in order to keep us both going. In 44 yrs. of taking lithium carbonate extended release (this one evens out throughout the day)I have no ill effects and will continue to use it until I die. Please give it a chance as this is how I got through nursing and social work school (which have therapy skills involved in both professions). My best wishes to all!

Most likely your doctor will omit telling you to drink lots of water!  Also, will not mention that Lithium blands ones emotions and very likely can cause serious kidney damage.  In his excellent book, ""Toxic Psychiatry,"" Psychiatrist Peter Breggan mentions his telling one Bipolar patient  to forget alcohol OR Lithium and just solve his problems!That's what I'm doing. 1)No counting pills, 2)No remembering to drink a lot of water, 3) No blood tests.  AND, instead of seeing a Psychiatrist, I now see a Social Worker. All those Psycho pills cause horrific side reactions.  Just remember prescription pills are ""artificial chemicals!""Also, do google, ""Dr. Dan Fisher, MD"" and visit his site.  Lots of self help articles from recovering WITHOUT psycho drugs to the characteristics of a recovered mental patient.  The stigma of being ""Mentally Ill"" is A+ horrific so I threw ALL having to do with Psychiatry out! and am now retraining for a new career, not majoring in taking pills and wasting time in hour-long appointments answering,""And, how do you feel?' and ""Are You taking your meds?""
Life is SO much better plus I now have a lot more self esteem!...Also, check your medical records. All of a sudden someone inserted into my record that I am Bipolar.  I checked the DSM, Psychiatry Bible, and I'm NOT bipolar as I am never manic and/or hypo-manic!..."

With that said I am now 30yr & was stable until I got pregnant with my youngest daughter (& last) My NOW Dr. (totally different Dr) tried for over 2yrs to stabilze. After a 4 month manic high my mom & husband had enough & insisted they go with me to a med check. The Dr knew my fear of this medication & my past with it but we'd tried everything my insurance would cover. Most of it being stuff I was on before too. He mentioned Lithium & I bawled. I've been on it 9 almost 10 months & haven't had any of the issues I had before. I've been able to lose weight not gain. I had tremors but they were due to anxiety & have gone away. I have to take water with me everywhere becuase I get very thirsty & if I get a smidge dehydrated I get dizzy & sick. At the start I had sunlight sensitivity but it went away. It's worth taking for my kids to have a mom.

I was trying one drug after another for almost 10 years, and just got more sick and then tried to shoot myself. Luckily the bullets were old, and didn't fire, hence my review. I take 1200mg, (2x 300mg pills at morning an at night), and it changed me completely in three days, and then plateaued out in a week. If you suffer from serious depression and are feeling without hope, really try this! I have gained a lot of weight however, and have hand tremors when my pulse is high, and muscle twitches in my foot when falling asleep. I went from 160lbs to 215lbs in this time period, and that is with a serious diet and daily exercise. I am 6'4"", so everyone just thought I was working out and theyu say I look great. But I have body issues and other fun stuff from my schizophrenia, that I only recently began treatment for (having not realized I had it until I got a Doctor who was pretty sharp). I also take Propranolol (Inderal) and Latuda. The Latuda is only 1.5 months in so I feel pretty positive. There is also cognitive dulling on Lithium, like a mental fog, but NOT like Seroquel! NOTHING like as bad as Seroquel. There is hope, friends, but we are all unique snowflakes and have to constantly work to keep our minds in shape. I only rated it 2 STARS for satisfaction because I hate feeling overweight and having no steady energy, etc etc. Hope this helps! "

It pulled me out of a depression that wanted to leave me crying for no good reason. It is a very wonderful mood stabilizer. So if you need something to work today and not 6 weeks from now I recommend lithium highly but beware of side effects. At the time this was the best thing for me but after awhile the side effects became worse. I gained 25 lb. in just a couple months. After two months I lost so much hair that my hair got so thin it felt like I had got a haircut. The worst thing of all was the restlessness which will keep you uneasy and twitchy the whole time. I'm sure this is dose dependent. I took 1200 mg daily. If you can deal with the fact that lithium might make you fat and  bald then this may be the perfect bipolar medicine.

    This is really the gold standard for bi-polar and cyclical depression treatment.  My background was to have fairly minor cyclical ""highs"" with some very powerful depressive ""lows"" maybe once a year or so.   My lows were bad enough that I had to drop out of college, where I had been an honor student, and I actually thought I had brain damage.   Anyway, finally discovered lithium as the first drug I tried after finally going to the doctor.   KEY POINT OF LITHIUM FOR ME:  DOSAGE CAN BE VERY EFFECTIVE AT A VERY LOW DOSE!!!   My typical dose for 90% of the year is 150 - 300 per day.   Then, for the depressive times, I may go up to 450 - 900, but only for a week or so.   "

During the time I had taken it, I felt better, my moods were a lot better, and everyone around me noticed a huge difference and could stand to be around me. Trust me I was a mess. I am now back on it. This I call my ""happy"" pill and a ""wonder"" drug. My marriage is a lot better because of it. I highly recommend it to someone with Bipolar Disorder. It controls every aspect of the illness. "
102$Condition: Bipolar Depression$10/18/2012 6:23:14 PM$Reviewer: tabpdb, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$5$4$I was diagnosed with depression in 2001. Something that took me over 10 years to finally admit to myself that something isnât right.  Paxil worked well at that time.  I stopped taking this about 2 years ago because of money issues.  I had a break down in May of this year.  My doctor put me back on Paxil.  After 4 weeks of it not kicking in he decided to check me for bipolar.  My counselor and he decided I was bipolar because the Paxil wasn't working.  I was placed on Lithium in June.  WHAT A DIFFERENCE! No more racing thoughts, no more suicidal thoughts, and the ability to smile now.  If I only knew then what I know now.  It feels so great to actually be happy and stop putting on the act of being happy.  Iâm still in the early stages of taking this.  My first blood test came back as low lithium in my system.  I see the doctor again in a month.  I highly recommend this to anyone who isnât sure.  Iâve had no side effects to worry about sometimes a little nausea but besides that the happiness I feel now is worth it.

Been on lithium for 15 years at the max of 1200mg a day. Diagnosed with PTSD and Schizoeffective. I hate this med. If you taste metal your not alone. It makes you numb physically and mentally. Along with the ""common"" side effects. My illness is not me. Do your research before this med. Yes it has helped some. But as i type this i am awaiting liver function tests my med dr was reluctant to do for all these years. Make sure your dr is doing your levels-kidney and thyroid tests at least every 3 months. I have liver damage. Now were waiting to see how bad. Be proactive @ your health. As far as weight gain..with lithium among the mix of meds..have always been small. 5ft 7 in 140lbs when i came home from the military. Give or take a month..no joke..within 5 to 6months i had gained 50lbs at least and today weigh 257...thats 117 pounds! Some of you might relate to this comment..Id rather be sane and fat than skinny and crazy. I am lucky I have known my boyfriend/bf for 21 years..im 35 now. You will get through this. Please weigh your options. Lithium is not for me. I want to live a life not puking and being dizzy and feeling like you sucked on a penny all day. Im so ill now im extremly fatigued. I cant walk the 5miles a day I could a few months ago. Stay well and good luck"

108$Condition: Bipolar Depression$8/5/2012 3:17:20 PM$Reviewer:  (Patient) $1$1$1$Worst medication ever. Effected me socially, sexually, emotionally. I feel this was the worst thing that ever happened to me when I took it. I now learned that lithium stops the estrus cycle in females and in males blocks the production of testosterone. It also interferes with nerve conduction at potassium channels. It can cause horrible effects and Lithium is NOT an essential element like carbon, potassium, or hydrogen. NAC (n-acetylcysteine) is a much more effective alternative for this disorder and is much safer and protects the kidneys. Clinical trials prove NAC's effectiveness. I am also looking into the drug Sodium Polystyrene to remove and leftover lithium in the body. It is used for excessive potassium, but clinical trials have shown that it is effective in reducing lithium in the body, while simultaneously supplementing potassium. Thanks for your time! :) Feel better everyone. Lithium is not always the answer.

NAC on the other hand, has been a life saver. I have my sex life back and some of my confidence. My disorder is in control too thanks to the NAC. :)

Most troubling is the nausea and that awful metal taste.  Haven't read where anyone else has experienced the metal taste though, so that troubles me a bit.  I can deal with the slight hand tremors as that only seems to occur when I'm tired or distracted.  The diarrhea is inconvenient, but getting better.  The hair loss doesn't concern me as I have massive amounts of hair.  The increased thirst kinda sux, but goes hand in hand with the increased trips to the bathroom.  It seems like I have several of the side effects, but nothing I can't deal with.  Lithium actually seems to be working for me.  Abilify made me a zombie, so it feels good to be ME again...with controlled depression and mania.

In over a decade of taking lithium this is the worse lithium I have taken with the major side effects being dehydration and constant urination at night. Plus it has a horrible taste from the time you take it and also in the morning.  Safe to say my pharmacy was able to special order the Roxane again. Stay away from the Glenmark lithium carbonate ER. It is not the same as the Roxane. Both are generic. The Roxane lithium carbonate ER has been great for me for many years.

Initially I started on 900 mg each night. Nausea didn't subside after 2 weeks so I did 600mg at night and 300 in the morning. This relieved the nausea. I gained 15 pounds and it seems impossible to loose it. Fogginess is a problem. And now, months later a new problem of headache and nausea is plaguing me. How I'm going to work under the side effects of both of these drugs is of great worry to me. LAMOTRIGINE has decimated my memory and makes me feel zombi-ish. Doc says this is better than where I was, a very dark place. I have to agree, but... :/

I have had no problems with it, that does not mean I won't in the future as we all know you become used to the med and it can become ineffective. but like all meds it depends on the person as to how and if it works. so do what your Doctor says and if you experience any side effects get to the Doctor.

This was the second time I'd been prescribed lithium carbonate and each time disabling tremor and inability of this medication to properly treat M-D has occurred. I've dealt with Bipolar I Disorder for ~ 40yrs and I'm now 54. My experience with having Bipolar Disorder has proven that ""maintaining regular sleep patterns"" is one of my most important strategies for preventing episodes and overall general daily health benefits. I realized in the my first few years of having M-D that episodes weren't as apt to happen as long as I could sleep ""moderately"" and that the general rules of good mental hygiene for all persons are likewise therapeutic for me.

I've been on every anti-depressant that you can think of--since I was 17, for my deep, dark depression.  I've also been on Xanax, Lorazapam, Clolonapin, etc.  to slow me down a bit. A lot of hits and misses through the years.  In my 20's and 30's Prozac and a bit of Xanax did the trick.  But after a while those meds no longer worked for me.  When I was 44 the doc diagnosed me with Bi-Polar.  I can lose my temper very quickly.  I get instant headaches, my blood pressure rises and I   say mean things that I regret immediatly, and I can't stop myself.  I can also get violent.  I'm crying and being very sorry to who my target was at the time within the next 15 minutes to a half an hour after my tempertantrum.  Then my depression is right out front again.  It's always there never letting up.  The thoughts in my mind are so dark, hopeless and very sad. Then the Doc put me on 120mg of Cymbalta and 1200mg of lithium.  Man I felt great.  I don't remember ever feeling light and happy.  I wasn't having dark thoughts.  I'd actually get out of bed and do my mom duties.  And I actually would leave my comforts of home and enjoy the outdoors.  But then the side effects started...vomiting, nausea, diarrea, off balance and slurring of words.  My blood test showed that I was toxic.  So now I'm on 600mg a day and I'm back to anger,hopelessness, and very sad and a bit suicidal.  I guess I need to be patient and hopefully find the right level of Lithium my body needs.  I have to stick with this.  I need to think positive.  I hope all this gabbing has helped someone out there...best wishes

It is very important to check your fingernails for discloration, rapid heartbeat, and diarrhea as these are symptoms of hyperthyroidism and too much lithium. Because I am a retired nurse I knew there was something wrong, so I am going to the dr. asap to treat the hyperthyroidism. Always get blood work so your thyroid, kidneys and heart keep functioning properly. Other than that Lithium has been a Godsend and allows those of us with bipolar disorder to find order in life.

It made me feel sluggish and unmotivated.  The depression abated slightly, but only because the drug deadened my mind.  I couldn't concentrate.  I gained weight.  The doctor brushed all this off, telling me it was caused by the depression. So they refused to change the medication; they piled other medications on top.  The other medications made the moderate fatigue severe.  The doctor also did not inform me about the health risks linked with the drug. Research drugs before you take them, even if you think you trust your doctor.

It was a nightmare! Any side effect that you could possibly get from these meds, i got! from lactating breasts to wetting the bed (resperdal) to massive weight gain and the interference of my thyroid medication absorption, the doctors didn't know that lithium blocks thebody from getting any synthroid, so needless to say my thyroid isn't doing so hot these days, thanks doc! lithium was the worst, it made me gain an excessive amount of weight during the time i ws taking it.  am 5'3"" and normally weigh between 125-127 lbs, while i was on lithium and all the rest i BALLOONED  to a WHOPPING 298lbs!!!!!!! at that point the lithium was useless because the weight gain was counter-productive towhat all these meds wer trying to accomplish. i was more depressed, more anxious, going anywhere out of my house looking like that for me was horrifying!
So i quickly stopped all my meds and the weight came off me within a month!!! i will never touch lithium or those other drugs again!!! i am trying to find a medication to help me with my bipolar that won't interfere with my thyroid hormone and won't make me gain THAT MUCH weight !"

I was very depressed and had tried several antidepressants without success. I finally had a ""ray of sunshine"" after taking Lithium, but I really worry about the s/e. Mostly, I'm concerned about potential kidney problems. I met a patient one day that was just having to start dialysis and she told me that she felt it was because of long term Lithium use. I would be devastated if I had to go on dialysis with kidney failure. Also, the main thing right now is that I'm experiencing hand tremors, sometimes really bad. They started me on Inderal to treat the tremors, but it is not working. I am a nurse and it is not cool to be a nurse and have shaky hands. That really bothers me and some days are worse than others. I'm taking 900mg daily and I am wanting to be tapered off of this medicine. I can't afford job troubles. I just hope I wont return to that deep dark place that I lived in before.

I swear I've been on everything and had every kind of side effect imaginable including spontaneous orgasms (not as fun as you might think). they kept wanting to call me bipolar but i was missing that oh-so important mania/hypomania. well, when i got on prozac it sent me into a hypo-mania. I checked myself into the hospital and got started on lithium. about 3 weeks now. i felt better within the first few days (my mania symptoms aren't the fun ones, i get irritated and snappy and i do the rapid cycling thing. very intense and NOT FUN. only side effects i experienced were peeing a million times a day (it is a salt) and drinking like i had just escaped the desert. i have been feeling like i am pregnant, i am so bloated! but i think this might be what being fat feels like. I have gained a bit of weight but my stomach literally is like a 5 month prego. i am waiting for someone to congratulate me. i have to ask my doc about this. but i am anticipating weight gain so i am getting my butt in gear with an exercise and eating plan. to everyone else on meds for being bi-polar.

207$Condition: Bipolar Depression$10/5/2010 11:09:32 AM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$"Lithium helped save my life.  I started Lamictal a good 6 years ago and that was a miracle to begin with then added Lithium to it 3 years ago and it was a perfect match.  

I have tried Abilify-hallucinations, Wellbutrin-a seizure, after months of taking it, and so many more A-Z meds that made me crazy. I despise waking up every morning knowing I have to take my meds and what have you, but I could not imagine my life without it ever again.  

It took 9 years of hell on earth for docs to discover that I was chemically imbalanced. I am one out of the few who began symptoms at the age of 12. Fist fights, mental hospitalizations, etc. were kicking high then and progressing. May I add, I was always the preppy girl that no one assumed anything from. 

Since discovery I have participated in a bipolar research study voluntarily, as if I would ask for anything, at an exquisite hospital. It was a for a year and am proud to say that I was the first to successfully finish the study. This regarded weekly meetings, evaluations, tests, homework. All I wished and had ever hoped for was to contribute something/anything from my illness so no other child has to go through what I did. I went under that study during a time where I was depressed, mania wasn't so bad. I have also donated towards the cause and etc. 

But all around, I can truly say,  Lithium and Lamictal changed my life. I understand not everyone will benefit from lithium but I hope people find their way. Bipolar Disorder is a constant battle and I still get down, very down, but I won't back down. Best.   "

The only complaint I have is the fact that they have to be taken at specified times (i.e. breakfast, lunch, dinner). It can be annoying to be sure that you have your medication on you at all times. I have not experienced major side-effects, though I have seen some dehydration and a minor increase in headaches (which I got on a regular basis before taking lithium). In the end, though, it is worth it to take the medication and be able to fully function, rather than not take anything at all.

I never said anything about trial and error, until I noticed my pills weren't working, first the Doctor I had, Dr Brown, took me off my Abilify, saying it causes weight gain, I was like thank god, I ain't getting older, I'm 21 btw, so he put me on Lamictal, I overdosed, learned my lesson, but then I got Dr. Sinato, If you live in Augusta, Georgia, please don't see him, he is Satan, the Lamictal obviously wasn't working, and he still started me over, like a doctor, he think he know everything, started taking it over again, Sinato acting all cocky and sadistic, saying I should be grateful that I'm on one pill, instead of three, I was happier on three, I was stable.  So anywho, instead of putting me on some pill called Giodon, or whatever, this dummy puts me on Seroquel, it gets worse, I gain weight, get all depressed, and he tries to send me to the psych ward, I don't go, he says if I continue like this, he will put me in there without me signing papers. So then my military id card expired, and so does my Tricare, he took me off Seroquel to ""help"" my mom out, and his hands are tied, yea now they are, if you would have listened to me the first time, so then bozo the clown puts me on lithium, Now I ran out of Lamictal, and Dr. Sinato (Satan) kept me on the Lithium, i was originally on 300 mg one at morning and at night, but why in the hell should i take 600 mg now at night? i barely sleep, and he said he was gonna put me in the psych ward for no sleep, he also forgot that I had a bad side effect with Adderall, I was like the exorcist, these effects are 5 times worse, he asked my mom the name of the pill I had a reverse side effect on, when I clearly named him all the pills I have been on, including Adderall, he's says I'm having psychosis, and going manic, when I actually feel depressed, shows you what he knows, he is the worst doctor ever."

I prefer the extended release formula because it keeps me more level, but I cannot afford it at this time.  Prior to being prescribed this medication, I had a very negative impression of it.  Others I had known who had used it claimed that they felt ""in a fog"".  This is not true for me, perhaps because I ""live"" in the depressive phase of the disorder and did not experience a loss of ""energy"" (i.e., mania).  I am Bipolar II, and rarely have extended manic episodes.  My mania expresses itself in brief but intense episodes of rage.  Lithium has greatly reduced the number and severity of those episodes.  To be sure, I still get disproportionately angry about everyday situations, but that is likely due to lingering, unresolved psychological issues.  I would encourage anyone to whom lithium has been recommended to at least give it a try.  It is one of the few psychiatric drugs whose need and effects can be physiologically established and tracked by blood test to determine lithium levels.  (Sigh, if only the same could be done for anti-depressants.)"

Racing thoughts are gone, moods swings are gone and I feel like a whole new person.I avoid the nauseas taking it with food.I still drink gallons of water a day but I do not care, it is not a hard thing to do for all the benefits.  However I have started feeling depressed again, some days I can't leave my bed. It has happened before but my doctor adjusted the dose and I got better. So far it has been the best medication I have taken. Still, like with all medications I am a little concerned with the long term side effects, but I know if I do not take it, the immediate effects are awful and scary. Before taking Lithium I was in a very lonely and dark place where I do not want to go back. I am pretty happy with the results of this medication. I would recommend people who needs it to give it a try.

My moods have stabilised very well. The only real problem I have with it is nausea and vomiting 1-3 hours after taking it. I deal with this by taking it last thing at night and sleeping through the side effects, although sometimes it wakes me up. I always have something small to eat with it too, and I have to keep my fluids up through the day to prevent dry mouth and a return of nausea. All worth it tho' to be rid of the lurching mood swings and pretty constant suicidal thoughts. And the regular blood testing picked up diabetes before I had any symptoms so that was a bonus!

When I became extremely manic and was admitted as an inpatient, I was loaded onto about 1500mg of Lithium combined with Zyprexa (Olanzapine).  I would have to say that the six months that i maintained the Lithium were absolutely horrible for me.  I felt emotionless and brain-dead for the latter 5 months, but the frightening part was that i was never able to attribute the negation of my emotions to the Lithium itself until I stopped taking the Lithium (almost by fluke).  If it were up to the doctors i believe they would have continued the Lithium.  In light of this, I do truly believe that the Lithium was effective, since having gone through that emotionless phase for several months turned out to have made a positive difference after I returned to ""normal"".  However, when I was re-admitted as an inpatient (probably because i had stopped the medication without the doctor's direction), I did everything I could to refuse treatment from Lithium and thankfully I was given Valproic Acid instead.  If you have problems with Lithium or are even afraid to take it (very understandable), I would highly recommend Valproic Acid instead."

So far this has been a life changing drug for me. Literally I thought I was going to kill myself and just hadn't picked the right method. I ended up at a State facility where the Doctor there put me on Lithium and a couple other drugs.  As of today, I no longer plot my death and it is actually worrying me that I'm not because I did it for so many years.  Then I find myself giving thanks to God...and the Dr. I havent felt this ""normal"" since I was 14y/o, I'm now 32. I'm not trying to promote Lithium for anyone else because I was scared to take it because of all the horror stories. But it's worked literal miricles in all aspects of my life and hope it continues for years to come.  By the way I have had some side affects; mild tremors, dry mouth and some stomach issues, but if it's that or depression or suicide, I'll take the side affects.  Good Luck everyone"

I also ended up with hypothyroidism with a direct cause linked to lithium.  I had such bad dry mouth that my stomach would be full before I felt I had enough fluids in my body.  It was somewhat effective but I did need crisis hospitalization 3 TIMES while on this medication. I did not feel successfully treated while on Lithium.

My doctor isn't sure that the lithium caused it but I am.  My weight was at 330 lbs. until I stopped the lithium about 6 months ago.  Since then I have lost 70 lbs, I feel great regardless of the kidney failure, and I am angry that a medicine that was supposed to help me led me to where I am now.

I am sure there are mild side effects that I experience, but I have been taking it for a third of my life now so I don't really know the difference. It is so worth any mild side effects. I am happily married and planning a pregnancy. This wouldn't be possible without Lithium. The key (and with any medication prescribed daily) is to take it EVERY day no matter if you want to or not. You just have to accept that you need it even when you feel fine. Sometimes I wonder about the long term effects and will begin to do research but I would rather be happy and live a healthy life now and many, many years to come. Also, for anyone wanting a family some day - my doctor recommends Lithium for being the safest for the fetus if take meds during pregnancy.

I used to take 40mg of prozac which killed my sex drive, and drained me very easily. Now im taking the same amount of Lithium, with 75mg twice a day of welbutrin, and 20mg of prozac. My sex drive is back, and I have alot more energy during the day and night. I always have to drink, if I dont my mouth gets dry, and feel gassy. I still have tremors whenever my heart rate goes up, or if im hungry. Im still getting used to the fact that Im Bipolor, but I see that im still very independent, strong minded, and still have the wonderful part of my bubbly/diva personality. So to people who are Bipolor I want to let you know, that you are just you. You have special spice in your personality when your not depressed, and we have strong minds when we are on the right meds, and we can probaly handle more than other people. I think. I hope it dosent only apply to me. Anyways, it feels good to share all of this. Be strong everyone!!!

I have always been very active and hyper oh and LOUD.  Now I'm more mellow and relaxed. I am a designer so being on this RX does have some drawbacks because I tend to be a bit lazy when it comes to work. But when I miss a couple days worth you can see a whole different side of me that I don't notice until someone tells me. I take prozac 20mg with this RX too for my depression.  The two medications work very well together.  I would definately recommend this RX to anyone who has simular symptoms as me.  hope this is helpful.
339$Condition: Bipolar Depression$12/1/2008 2:00:13 PM$Reviewer: CureWorseThanDisease, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$"In mid-November I began taking a low dose of generic (Roxane Labs) lithium carbonate ER.  By 6:30 am the morning after my first bedtime dose I had developed these symptoms: severe nausea, vomiting, and spasmodic diarrhea; chills and sweats; stomachache with cramping and very strong burning sensation from diaphragm to pelvis; intense body ache; strong contractions in muscles of legs, arms, and back that I was unable to stop by conscious efforts to relax individual muscles; intermittent low-grade fever; fine tremor; frequent short bursts of violent shaking / shivering.  I felt agitated and I could not concentrate.  I was clumsy and unsteady on my feet.  Light-headedness developed later in the day.  I was able to sleep only in brief (one-to-two hour) naps; the pain, agitation, muscle tension, and other symptoms kept me awake for about 18 hours of the 24-hour day.  I could not keep anything in my stomach.  On two days I had to go to Urgent Care for IV fluids and pain relief.  Emotionally, I felt very, very depressed.  (Ironic, that.)  After four days I stopped taking the lithium.  Symptoms began to subside slowly, with the nausea and vomiting passing off first.  At the first of December I am still having trouble with agitation, fatigue, clumsiness, and the need to stick to a bland diet.  My pharmacist says that the only way to determine if I had an adverse drug reaction is to re-challenge.  I would rather backpack on mid-summer's day through seven layers of the Inferno than let this stuff pass my lips again.  A complicating factor is that I am sensitive to sodium lauryl sulfate, an ingredient in some toothpastes.  If I use these toothpastes I get canker sores.  Sodium lauryl sulfate (also called sodium dodecyl sulfate, SDS, and other names) is listed by Roxane Labs as an ""Inactive Ingredient"" in its generic lithium formulation.  Inactive, my foot.  I call for FDA reform: it is wrong to list such an ingredient as ""inactive."""

Side effects were a concern at the beginning.  Dry mouth and weight gain were an issue for the first year.  The weight gain was primarily due to having an even, level mood with the same calories and less desire to exercise.  Request the extended release versions of lithium carbonate from your doctor, Lithobid or Eskalith to even each day out.  This drug gets a bad rap, because forms of lithium have been used for years, but it changed and saved by life.

Cardio triggers the bodies natural ""feel Good"" hormones the endorphines and it really helps push away the clouds.  Yes side effects can be bad but the alternative is far worse,  and I NEVER want to be locked up in a psych ward again so I'll drink plenty of water, exercise and take care of myself,  the depression will still come and temporary antidepressants will get me out of the pit,  but there is no magic pill for ANY illness and if you sit around waiting, it wont happen and acting on every impulse will get you in trouble,  sleep every night, eat a healthy diet,  exercise, stay off drugs and alcohol, caffiene and most cold meds,  and you will make progress.(I know easier said than done,  but could I say all that if Lithium didnt work?)

366$Condition: Bipolar Disorder in Remission$9/1/2008 3:14:52 PM$Reviewer: 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years$4$1$4$I started taking lithium in 1978 after several manic episodes and took it until 1985 (1200 mg/day for 3 yrs, remaining 4 yrs at 900 mg/day), and it had the effect intended. I had no other problems with mania while I was taking it. I did have pretty much all of the side effects: tremors, confusion, sweating, radical weght gain, and so on. I had to be taken off the drug in '85 because it had damaged my kidneys permanently, and at this point in my life the damage appears to be getting worse. I just want to emphasize what's been said a few times in the comments I've read here: keep after your doctor to get you down to the lowest dose that's effective for you and make sure your blood work is done and evaluated regulary.

I had my levels checked every six months. About three weeks ago, I had a manic episode despite being on maintenance lithium. In response to the episode, my doctor increased my lithium dosage. I am unable to determine if my return to a normal state was due to the lithium increase or the seroquel that I was started on. However, I do like taking the lithium instead of the alternative anti seizure drugs. With the lithium, I have little to no side effects. The anti seizure drugs made me sleepy all the time and had other side effects.

It helped me through some really bad episodes, but was hard to maintain due to blood tests once a month. Now I am on lamictal and it works wonders with no side effects. Talk to your doctor about other options if lithum is not working for you or the side effects are too hard to take. You do not have to suffer. Don't give up! Bi-polar people are very creative, deep thinkers. You can succeed - - you have to accept your illness and then you can manage it. It's a chemical imbalance --- it's not something that you can ""will"" away. There is a sun behind those dark clouds. You may not see it now, but it doesn't mean that it's not there. Your brain just can't function well enough to allow your mind to see it. Give your brain what it needs to function properly - - whether it's medication, the right diet, exercise -- come up with a plan with your doctor and figure it out. Don't give up! It took a couple of months for the lamictal and effexor to kick in, but it has been helping me tremendously for the past 2 years. I have been depression-free for over 2 years now and have never felt better! You can too. "

I've been on Lithobid two different times (I discontinued it when pregnant and started again post partum). The first time, my therapeutic dose made me feel numb, but better than I was prior to when it was prescribed to me. The dosage was somewhat high. Currently, the second time around, my Lithobid dose was cut in half and another medication accompanied it (Wellbutrin SR). Thus far, I'm in a better realm of mind, but not as peaceful as I once remembered when I was on a stronger Lithobid dose. I still get depressed, but I dont get manic anymore. I'm hoping to discuss the difference with my doctor. Overall, Lithobid can be daunting considering the ingredients, side effects, etc. ; however, it certainly helped

I have a milder form of Bipolar called Cyclothymic Disease. It has been very helpful in controlling by manic episodes.  I have not had a depressive episode in over two years which in the past I have taken imipramine(an older medication).  I have only taken the latter when I feel a depressive episode coming on.  I am a professional and cannot tolerate the tremor that the severe imipramine causes with the lithium to perform my duties as a dentist so I have been taking over the years propranolol(10 mg.) which erases the ""shaking"".  Only side  effects that I have had besides the tremors are thirst, fluid intake and of course voiding quite often.  I can handle those though. 

In closing I would say it has been very helpful and on a number of occasions before I began the lithium suicide was certainly an alternative."

Yes there are some side effects that are not so desireable but geeze they are liveable side effects. The only issue I have with this med is that I am supposed to take it 3 times a day and that is just a pain to get in that dose in the middle of the day.

However I am able to sleep at night now, my brain is not constantly wandering, I'm not freaking out over stupid little stuff, and I do not feel depressed in the least.

Too much lithium lead to unwanted effects: nausea, severe case diarrhea at times with less than 1 min. to park it on a commode! My hands/fingers had slight twitch off & on. No dizziness, seizures,or slurred speech.  Maybe increase in urine relayed to fluid intakes. I found 1200 mg/day was too scary for me!  

I was ""Stuck"" in the middle of the roller coaster ride, half way up-half way down. No super highs at the top, & no bottom gut wrenching lows.

NO FEELINGS, NO ENGAGEMENTS JUST A ZOMBIE IN LIFE!

After 7 yrs on Lithium ('79-'86) I got off!

I rode the roller coaster called LIFE! UPS, DOWNS, & all the good & bad in between for over 20 years.

I WOULD NOT EXCHANGE ONE MINUTE OF IT.  LIFE'S TOO SHORT, DON'T LIVE SOMEBODY ELSE'S EXPECTATIONS.

With Lithium, a ""tad"" too much in your system and you're getting manic, ""tad"" too low suicide creeps back.  Problem: Doctors Rx @ 300,600,900,1200mg's. but your body may only need 725 mg.

CLOSER blood lithium monitoring should be like it is for diabetics. 
 

WEB MD: TALK to your Dr. IMMEDIATELY! if these.... effects occur they MUST BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY.

I'm back on 1200mg Lithium, Aug. '07. Diarrhia was killing me 3-4x/day for 2 wks in Nov. 07.  Old Dr. cut me to 900 mg and it went away.  New dr. put me back to 1200mg & guess what!?  So last week my new Dr. changed my Rx to DIVALPROEX 500mg 2x/day.  

I'm scared as hell! Divalproex causes: 1st symptom  is ""diarrhia"" as too much Lithium!  The sweet spot Divalproex ""has rarely caused serious (sometimes fatal)liver problems"".  A disabled vet, in need of his disability pay must take the new medicine. If I am around in 5-6 mo. I will repost! Live Long!

There is only a small difference between the correct amount of lithium and too much lithium. Therefore, it is important that your doctor monitor you closely during treatment. Keep all medical and laboratory appointments while you are taking lithium."

It lessens the severity of everything. Also, after a while you become pretty boring to hang out with. You start staring at walls and watching Garden State with new found insight. Its not too bad though, like being in a perpetual fog, and then one day noticing ""hey, my hands are shaking."" Then again 1200mg will do that to you. With proper dosing it is effective for controlling the impulsive. "

However, my 16 year old bipolar son, was given this drug & within 2 weeks of starting the med he developed one of the worst cases of cystic acne we have ever seen including his dr. He is virtually disfigured! Even after stopping the med the acne did not stop. Prior to the introduction of Lithium he had a usual pimple here or there[nothing big]. Virtually, overnight he looked like his face had caught on FIRE! I took him to the ER where they dx him with impentago!UGH!!! His Psych dr. gave him antibiotics that didnot help. On to the dermatologist. He seen 2, they end result with that was ""We did all we can do w/ injections & meds & washes, look into ""other skin therapies"" plastic surgery,as the cysts [keloid-type] are so large and dark pink that they cover his entire shoulder area, most of his back & chest & his beautiful face. It's still beautiful to me!  Needless, to say this has caused him to become a ""hermit,"" as he won't leave the house,no school, no job, no life! The emotional scars are as bad [maybe worse] as the scars/acne on his skin. I don't blame the dr.{completely} as I know you never know how a person's body will react to a med. My son on the other hand certainly doesen't feel the same way! We can't afford plastic surgery (as he is no longer our medical insurance due to his age)& no one can guarantee that he'll look any better after. My aim is NOT to scare anyone I WANT ONLY TO WARN ANYONE WHO IS GIVEN THIS OR ANY MED TO BE ACUTELY AWARE OF ANY SIDE-EFFECTS YOU MAY HAVE - WHEATHER THE DR. EXPLAINS THEM OR NOT! We were only told after the breakouts started that there is always a ""chance"" especially in adolecent ""boys"" that this type of side-effect could happen,but the dr. had never seen it to the degree my son has had to suffer with.  PLEASE BE AWARE OF YOUR OWN FEELINGS WITH NEW MEDS OR PARENTS KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON YOUR CHILD FOR ANYTHING UNUSUAL -- I PRAY FOR GOOD HEALTH FOR ALL."

This is the first medicine I've ever taken that I have been able to feel like a normal person, and live as though I am me and not a diagnosis. It's hard enough to deal with 20 years of what you find to be normal, only to suddenly have a ""mental illness"" and have to possibly take drugs the rest of your life. I've been through all of it, extreme mania, depression, attempted suicide, hospitalized 4-5 times. I had never been hospitalized or had any problems in my life until that day when I was 20 years old! I went off and on all these medicines that made me gain weight, I felt like a zombie a lot, lost lots of jobs. It all just really put my life on hold for a long time. I've been on Lithium for 11 months now, and finally living a real life again! I'm so thankful and am just glad to be me again! If I have to take something forever, I choose this.:)"

I have been on the drug consistently for over a year in a half.  In regard to mood stabilization, I have not experienced a hypo-manic episode since the onset of treatment.  I have, however, experienced many depressive episodes.  I don't attribute this to the medication.  After a trial and error phase with my prescriber, we found that Latuda works the best with my depression.   The only side effects that I regularly face is extreme thirst and excessive urination.  I was taking my dose with dinner, shortly before bedtime and my sleep patterns were erratic, waking up around 4 to 5 times a night.  Now I am taking my dose with breakfast, I am still thirsty and urinating frequently, however I am not trying to sleep so it's a win in that category.  The lithium doesn't zap my energy nor make me feel drowsy.  Overall, I would say that this medication has been incredibly helpful with stabilizing my mood.  My only complaint with the lithium/latuda combo, I have a non-existent sex drive.

I had a few manic and depressive episodes during those years but the  most part it kept me stable. However, because of the lithium I developed hypothyroidism and kidney failure.. This happened mostly because my psychiatrist at the time did not monitor my blood levels adequately. After three years in dialysis I was lucky to get a kidney transplant. I'm taking seroquel now and it's been very effective as my maintenance therapy. I wish I had never taken lithium. Anyone considering taking lithium should really think it over and explore alternative medications or a least make sure that your blood levels are monitored properly.

After 2 hospital stays in the psych ward in a month, i was put on an extreme amount of depakote as a mood stabilizer. I became violent and would have mental blackouts, so i took myself off the med. Ive been on lithium for about 3 mos. i take 900 mg/day. Except for having a cloudy head, moderate insomnia, and feeling useless around the house and with the kids, I accredit the fact that im still alive to the lithium. So the side effects are a small price to pay.

All of the alternatives like valproate and atypical-antipsychotics had me thinking about what was worse, the disease or the cure.  At a 1.0 lithium level, I am symptom free-on both the high and low side of the emotional spectrum.

I can only hope the side effects ease so that it doesn't conflict with my job. Overall I say give it a shot if you have episodes like me or don't like leaving the house or like to harm others then Lithium may work for you. So far it's working for me.

I tried one other medication prior to lithium and was not feeling exceptionally great. My Dr. swears by lithium, he wanted me to try that as my first med., which I rather have tried it as a last resort. Been on lithium for about 8 days now and, honestly, I've never been more depressed in my life. I take it 3x a day and cry all day. It makes me sooooo hungry, and tired. It's probably not the best med for me, due to the fact that I've battled an eating disorder for 15 years. I didn't experience any symptoms of the disorder returning when I was on the other medication, so I probably should of stayed on that, but my doctor insisted lithium was best. I'm sure it works for some, but all I want to do is get off of it, and find what works best for me.

535$Condition: Bipolar Depression$1/7/2008 8:27:19 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$5$5$This medication was a life saver for me!  I started taking it while I was hospitalized for an attempted suicide. I was still taking my other medications but they obviously were not cutting it for me! I have been handling my disorder very well ever since lithium came into my life.
536$Condition: Manic-Depression$1/4/2008 5:04:39 PM$Reviewer: $2$1$3$I had a very difficult time with this medication.  Although it did help my bipolar mania, it caused me to gain a significant amount of weight.  I felt like my mind was in a fog and became lethargic.  The side effects of this medication outweight its effectiveness for me.

I think, in my thoughts, it confirmed I had a serious illness (as well as potential bad side effects) and so I avoided it - for as long as I could. It took a good hypomanic episode to convince me to try it.
I did have some typical side effects; shaky hands, dry mouth, loss of short term memory and severe nausea. They all went away fairly quickly (the nausea was yuck..needed to space my doses)and they were more annoying than anything.  
Now, more than a yr later I am feeling more myself than I can remember since this illness first beset me.  I feel clear headed and not weighted down. I can see beauty and enjoy it.  I have more energy that lasts all day.  I have a will to live and a mind that desires it. Thoughts of death are now rare. Thoughts of suicide began to disappear shortly after taking Lithium and an antidepressant. 
I look back to being first diagnosed and the hell that followed of trying to find the right blend of meds... to beginning Lithium... to today.  I am so incredibly thankful for the medication and dear family who had the strength to get me to this point. I thank God for rescuing me.  I am alive for a purpose and I aim to do good and live well.  I have my life back.  I know what true joy is. I am glad I took the chance to try Lithium."

It spiked my blood pressure, requiring medication. Frequent thirst and urination; loss of focus and memory, shaking and fine motor difficulties, and fatigue.

It is one of the hardest on your body, but it really works.  Maybe not how one thinks it should but it does level you out as much as possible.  Should help those who self medicated like I did as well ease that transition.

And it seemed to help others but didn't do what I expected it to do so I got off of it. I myself like Ativan & Strattera.

If it weren't for the random addition and subtraction of various antidepressants/antipsychotics in that period, I would have to say I see very little change in my behaviour.

553$Condition: Bipolar Depression$12/30/2007 1:46:18 AM$Reviewer: Vickiamos, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $4$3$5$I don't know if it is the disease or the medication, but it seems that since I've been diagnosed and treated with bipolar disorder, I'm no longer capable of having genuine feelings.  The only feelings I have are when I'm angry.  There is no sensitive, loving person inside me anymore.  It seems like with all the advances in pharmacology, someone could come up with something better.  And this is one of the older and in my experience best ones.  I've tried cymbalta, effexor, lamictil, neurontin, and yes, I've used anti-depressants with it because otherwise I'm too depressed to even get out of bed.  The only thing I'm aware of that I haven't taken is Depakote.  I know the mind is a complicated thing, but I wish there were another way besides drugs.  I've read something about a shock instrument placed at the base of your brain to shock the chemicals or transmitters, or whatever to change the chemical embalance.  I'm not quite sure if I'm ready for this..but I'm really sick of the drugs.  I live through the drugs, and I'm not living at all.
