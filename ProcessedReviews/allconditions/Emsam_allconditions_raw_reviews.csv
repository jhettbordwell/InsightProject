Such an amazing medication. Feel like myself, tons of energy, very social, and confident. Been on almost every SSRI and loads of other psych meds that have never worked. 
The lowest dose of 6mg allows me to eat whatever I want (that I'm not supposed to) not worry about having a hypertensive crisis. 
I take 200 mg of 5htp (the direct precursor to serotonin) a day, too. 
Never had any adverse reactions. 

Feel great and love life!"

Horrible side effects of paranoia, mania, aggression,can't sleep for days, and still depressed all the time. Ultimately cost me a marriage. Doesn't cause as many migraines as other anti-depressants but side effects are worse than the disease. This was the second attempt to use this medicine.
2$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$3/5/2018 8:48:00 AM$Reviewer: Eric, 45-54 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$4$3$I have been on Emsam transdermsl 6mg for two weeks now. I have noticed more energy, a little more motivation to exercise and take care of stuff that I usually just avoid, so maybe it is starting to work. No problems with the patch itself so far. I have read that it is not truly effective as an antidepressant until you get to 9 or 12 mg. Have others found this to be true? I think I will need to increase the dosage. My only concern is an increase in stimulant kinds of side effects. I'm having trouble sleeping and I'm finding that I'm irritable and occasionally uncharacteristically angry. I know it's only been a couple of weeks so I'm hoping those side effects will go away or at least lessen or even out. But I would appreciate any input about the robustness of 9/12mg compared to 6mg. Thanks.

But, otherwise am very satisfied with it.  I am on 9mg but have been upgraded to 12mg.  Not sure of the difference this will make.
4$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$12/10/2015 12:48:23 PM$Reviewer: Nora, 45-54 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$I have been depressed my entire life. Bi-Polar and suicidal just as long with many attempts. I take a mood stabilizer which helps a lot. I've been on many anti depressants too. I've been on Nortriptiline for 4.5 years at 100 ml. I started out with the patch now making two antidepressants. Now I am down to the 12 ml patch only with no side affects at all. I feet much better. I felt numb for a long time and I have more emotions now than I have in the last 5 years. I am mentally ill and I accept that. I keep myself very busy doing good things and hanging with good people who lift me up. I will always be suicidal, but I am aware of the signs and I have many tools in place with the best psychiatrist in the world. I can call him anytime. He has saved my life and so has this medicine. 
5$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$8/20/2015 6:33:06 PM$Reviewer: Caelian, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$3$None of the SSRIs I've taken have been successful and I think I've tried them all over the past 20 years! So my psychiatrist decided to switch me to an MAOI, and he chose EMSAM. Nothing has worked so well for me and it has improved the quality of my life tremendously.  The only side effect I suffer is from the adhesive and my doctor got very creative with that.  He has prescribed a nasal spray mist called Triamcinolone.  I spray it a couple of times on my hand and rub in into the site where I'm going to put the patch.  Let it dry for a few minutes and apply the patch.  The spray contains an antihistamine and cortisone, which helps with any allergic reaction to the adhesive.  I haven't broken out or itched at all since I started this. I hate to see anyone miss out on what I consider a cure for depression due to the awful rash associated with the EMSAM patch.

Seems to be working but have tingling in my hands and feet and sone itching not too bad.  Not sure if this side effects will eventually subside.  Anyone else have these side effects?

7$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$10/25/2014 11:09:10 PM$Reviewer: GuyInNYC, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$3$"Five other medications (Prozac, Wellbutrin, Effexor, [Effexor + Lamictal], and Elavil) as well as months of weekly outpatient ECT treatments all failed to provide me with the degree of relief from depression that I got with Emsam 12 mg. The 6 mg and 9 mg patches were helpful, but 12 mg is best for me. I've been on the 12 mg patch for over 3 years. Biggest downside: inconvenience of patch. I'm a moderately hairy male and sometimes sweat heavily. I've reduced to once or twice a month the frequency that the patch falls off and needs replacing before 24 hours by sticking the patch on nearly hairless regions on my upper thighs and outer pelvis. No other part of my body works as well. This region that is best for patch adherence also happens to be least often seen by others, thus preserving my confidentiality. While Emsam relieves my depression far better than anything else I've tried, the only unwanted side effect I've noticed is occasional itchiness at the patch site. Once or twice a month, itchiness forces me to remove a patch before the 24 hours. In all, I lose 2 to 4 patches a month to either sweating or itching. From experience I've learned it's important to replace a patch promptly, not ""skip"" partial days after a patch falls off. Instructions say patches should not be worn longer than 24 hours each, but if I followed that, with 2 to 4 patches lost each month, I'd be in danger of running out too soon. I've found no downside to occasionally wearing a patch an extra 8 hours (32 hours total). As to dietary restrictions, I've experimented with small amounts of tyramine foods using a blood pressure monitor. They did not affect my blood pressure. I still generally avoid tyramine foods as the instructions advise, but I don't worry about occasional small slips."
8$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$7/18/2014 4:43:08 AM$Reviewer: Jkay, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$4$5$"Started on emsam when approved by FDA in 2006 after nearly 5 years of disabling MDD which was resistant to all anti-d's and other treatments , including ECT.  Within 3 weeks of starting on 6/mg-24 hr dose all scores had improved significantly and I was able to feel emotions and function akin to normal. in the first 3 years my dosage needed to be increased and I've been on a 12/mg-24 hr for about 6 years, and on emsam without a break for over 8 years. The side effects I've experienced have been horrible, including acute non positional vertigo, which was disabling for over 1 year; migraines shuck if never had prior to starting emsam but are now fairly regular and can be quite severe; severe chronic constipation; digestive problems; adult onset narcolepsy; severe and chronic insomnia; memory problems; extremely low blood pressure; musculoskeletal problems and many others that have all been attributed to long term emsam use.  In addition to emsam therapy I take 2 benzos for anxiety, OCD, PTSD, panic, social and other phobias.  After years of darkness and nothingness this trio works very well for me, and while I dream of a day I (we all) can live without medications to function and be cured instead, I am able to participate more in activities. I am by no standard ""well"" and I've had several relapses, 3 which were fairly long in duration (>3 months to ~7 months), but overall my quality of life with regard to mood is greatly improved. Until there is another alternative from a new medication, drug class, treatment or cure I will be on emsam unless it loses its efficacy almost completely. The alternative is worse than the bandaid for me."

The ease of use is excellent. I have fibromyalgia and this might also be helping my pain, fatigue, and libido since I've noticed improvement with all. At first I craved sweets but don't now. I have mild irritation at the patch site. I wake up at least once at night to urinate (where I didn't before) and I also want a snack at that time, too. Even with night eating, I think I'm losing weight on this medication. Expensive w/out insurance: $700 p/mo.

My one concern is that I am definitely losing my hair on this. I will see my psychiatrist next week for a one month follow up and if the hair loss is easily remedied, I'll stick with it."

I have to wash & dry the area completely before applying the patch EVERY DAY! Sometimes some things make me pretty sad=I have found that to be normal, and it doesn't last either. I am grateful for how I now feel. I have found that I cannot do ANY FORM OF SUGAR, or I am buzzed and do not want to go to bed! This has been the most difficult for me cuz I crave sweets all the time...Sometimes I just end up staying up more than I wanted to...But once in bed, I am out like a light! I wish we could respond individually to others on this site... I eat bananas all the time in my oatmeal. I use 9mg patch. It is AGED cheese that we can't have. ALCOHOL is a depressant! Please do your homework! Coffee is a stimulant, I found a substitute I like, I had to cuz I am on Adderall for ADHD. From my personal experience:I will never go to a regular MD with our kind of illness=they just don't know how to diagnose, nor can they prescribe correct medication.I was on EffexorXR from a MD. Totally wrong medication for me that was causing more depression! Worst withdrawal ever in my life!  Being honest with myself and my doctor has always been the best way to go. And, I have found that if I plan my outfit for the day the night before, then I can apply my patch accordingly! Yes it is expensive, and I am so grateful for insurance,(vote O'Bama) but my happiness is priceless !!

EMSAM appears to be weight neutral, no sexual side effects (some from Lamictal, however), very sharp memory and brain function (absolutely NO brain Fog that i've noticed), increased energy and decreased isolation, increased range of emotion (the Flat feeling from SSRI's not nearly noticeable). dehydration / need for increased water intake is readily noticeable, especially when combined with Lamictal. food restrictions are not difficult to adhere to.. i am a vegetarian and eat/drink soy products, noticed no issues. some foods that i Cheat (have just a little.. like Soy Sauce or canned soups) give me immediate headaches and mild blood pressure rise (although i take propranolol to prevent migraines so the side effect controllable), caffeine caused increased dehydration, nicotine lozenge caused heart palpitations, taken too close to bedtime causes mild insomnia. out of every antidepressant i've taken (approx 10-15? over 18 years), EMSAM has the least side effects and most effective, without impairing cognitive abilities (memory, Fog) or causing anxiety/panic attacks or major emotional stunting/numbing.

I could hardly hold the steering wheel of my car, move my laptop around, text on my phone.  I thought I had strained them in yoga or something, but the pain just got worse.  Finally, the sleep side effects of the Emsam really started to kick in and I'd wake to find that I was clutching all the fingers of my hands down over my thumbs and nearly pulling them out of socket.  Think ""teeth grinding"" but with hands/fingers. (I do also wear an occlusal guard for teeth grinding that I've had for years.)

I also started waking up with hot sweats, really ""shallow"" sleep that would slip directly into and out of unsettling dreams and wasn't very restful, and what kind of felt like a heady/spacey and maybe even heart-palpitating feeling during the day. Combined with the drug not seeming to help my depression at all, I guess I am looking for a new drug. One that doesn't make my thumbs ache.

I know not every drug works for every person, but my experiences with Emsam seemed a little undocumented, so I thought I'd share."

I find that the drug makes me feel, not artificially not-depressed, but normal. I have a full range of emotions, not the muted feeling i got from some SSRIs. At first there was slight tremors, a bit trouble sleeping and weight loss.  It felt like I'd drunk too much coffee. But those symptoms faded after about 2 weeks. I think there is a bit of an effect on my sex drive.  Nothing too terrible, but I notice I am a bit slower to respond. Also, i notice that it magnifies the affects of alcohol.  I feel drunk very quickly, but also become sober quickly.  I find this discourages over-indulging. Overall, I am extremely pleased with Emsam which allows me to function and enjoy life.

The first month & 1/2 I had not felt so relaxed, steady, clear thinking, back to my old self in I do not know how long.  Then I began to hallucinate.  Every where I went I saw little filthy dirty naked babies crawling around.  Across the road, down isles in grocery and department stores, on the alter at church, in the dump.

The pharmacist seemed concerned when I was first prescribed Emsam.  He had asked to report to him if I had any problems.  I think he felf I would have a problem with the mix of the other drugs I was on.  I not only suffer from depression on the norm (in my early life I was able to keep it in check without drugs) but I have a disease that causes depression, the cure for the disease causes suicidal depression.  I have gone into treatment 2x for it but to no avail. On a daily basis I take 12-13 other prescriptions so that may have had something to do with my problem with the Emsam.

Truly I was so very disappointed that I could no longer take it.  As I related in the beginning Emsam was the best thing that happen to/for me in years.  The drugs I am on now and before Emsam they keep me functioning but with no real love or passion of life.  And with no desire to socialize.  No real desire to get up in the morning.  Life just seems to be passing me by."

I like not having to take one-more  pill and the fact you put it on right away in the morning.  Currently, my blood pressure & pulse rate is very near the normal levels. To keep skin irratation at bay, you do need to switch the sites you apply it to daily.  The only thing I hate is when I apply it to my shoulder and later I want to wear a sleeveless shirt. When others have noticed my patch, reactions have been null.  Combined with another depression medication I have done very well on this regimen.  Being on other non-depression medication I fine it is hard to tell which side effects are caused directly by this drug.
38$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$7/7/2009 5:21:27 PM$Reviewer: Cindy, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $1$2$5$I have now been on Emsam patches for about 1 1/2 years. In a previous post, I commented that I was doing well with Emsam. Now my sleep is erratic and my mood is depressed as it used to be. I am now on 12 Mg. patches which I went on because the 9 Mg. seemed to stop being effective. My psychiatrist is at a loss for what to do and things seem hopeless.
39$Condition: Other$4/10/2009 12:19:08 AM$Reviewer: Hope, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$4$2$"After suffering from depression for over 17 years, and trying so many different meds/combos I can't remember them all, Emsam has been the 2nd most effective drug. The most effective was Prozac for the first nine years, but after it pooped out, Emsam has been the next best. I've been on it about two years and sadly it's effectiveness is diminishing. Being hopeless about ever being fairly-well again I even had ECT last fall--another treatment that lasted for a only a couple of months-- but that is another story. Last year I was finally and accurately diagnosed with bipolar I. I haven't had any side effects with the patch, but it is not easy to use. Peeling off the backing and sticking it on your skin without any edges folding under takes time. Also the darn things will not stick if the area is not really clean and dry. I would clean the area with alcohol first. If you get it on good, it will stay during a shower and even swimming. They only stick well on my arms, so sometimes nosey/rude people ask what they are. I would say, ""It's a smoking patch,"" and they would reply that they'd never seen one like that. So I started saying it was birth control which shut them up. But I guess that one won't work for the guys! It's also VERY EXPENSIVE. I had to pay for it one month because of my deductible--$600. I  hope Emsam or something else will work for you. This disease is so draining--finances, work (I'm disabled), friendships, just living hour to hour. Wishing you or your loved ones the best of luck. Don't give up!"

41$Condition: Other$3/16/2009 10:53:24 PM$Reviewer: Deneen, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$I had insomnia so my doctor thought it might be because I was depressed.  He  prescribed Lexapro which upset my stomach, so I stopped it.  He then suggested I use the Emsam patch which would cause no side effects other than some itching where the patch was.  That sounded great so I had the prescription filled and started using it that night (it's expensive even with insurance).  He was right, it caused some itching which was no problem.  After a week or two, I started having ringing in my ears.  Since my doctor hadn't mentioned that side effect, and it was listed no where in the literature that came from the drug store or in the box, I thought the ringing must be caused by something else so I continued using the patch for another 2 weeks.  BIG MISTAKE.  I finally looked on WebMD and found that ringing in the ears is a rare, BUT SEVERE, side effect.  It was a weekend and my doctor wasn't in so I talked to the druggest.  He said if it were him, he would stop it if it otherwise wasn't helping me feel better.  So I stopped it.  That was about 2 months ago and I still have ringing in my ears so I'm assuming it's permanent.  I don't understand why drug companies are not required to disclose ALL the possible side effects, and especially the side effects that can do long-term damage.  I would recommend anyone contemplating using this medication to check all the side effects, not just the ones listed in the literature that comes with it.  I sure wish I had.

Doctor says we will raise it up to 9mg after one month on 6mg.  I've been on every type of med. for 25 years and dissapointed that I still struggle to even stay alive.  Dr. says we should try ECT next if 9mg does not work.  Skin rash is not bad and does not pose a big problem with using the medicine.

They say you shouldnt cut the patch but i have to in order to find just the right dose for me & it seems to be ok. I go through bouts of insomnia, constipation, slight confusion or anxiety, & trouble remembering things. but these are tolerable compared to what i've had to deal with in the last 15 years. I switch the patch back and forth from right upper thigh to left upper thigh, it helps to stick if you hold your palm over it for about 30 seconds, the heat & pressure makes it stay on longer. I get very minor skin irritation but if i did i doubt it would stop me from taking it. Most antidepressants will give you side effects, but for me Emsam has positives that outweigh the negatives. :)

I have been using them for about 1 1/2 yrs.  I have tried every kind of tape to keep them on and the only tape that I have used is silver duck tape.lol I saw where one person in their experience with Esman was to cut them in half. The druggist said that was bad as there may be more medicine come out at once and that wouldn't be good.  I tried not using them for 1 week and my depression was very bad.  Can't take any oral meds. as I have a very nervous stomach and it actually cooks my stomach, even a coated baby asperin hurts.

Depression was mild to start with, but not feeling like I want to cry all the time.  More energy.  Side effects so far: weight loss, major headaches (Excedrin usually takes care of that), increased heart rate, some restlessness, some dizziness. This is my first MAOI.  Lexapro worked but made me apathetic. Wellbutrin caused hives, mania, suicidal thoughts, loss of appetite, etc.  Emsam is very expensive without insurance!

52$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$4/24/2008 6:59:26 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$3$5$"I have had major depression all my life, and been on every drug. EMSAM has alleviated a great deal of the depression--and that is truly amazing. My energy level is way up from previously. I responded very quickly to 6mg. I have not had any skin irritation at the patch site. I alternate arms each day. 

I have also lost weight!

I'm pleased that I don't have to be too concerned about the dietary restriction at 6mg.

I have however developed trouble sleeping and started taking Ambien. The worst problem is a terrible restlessness that even yoga, exercise and meditation won't relieve. I even have stress rashes on the backs of my hands. I'm hoping to be able to manage this because the anti-depressive response has been so remarkable--when so little else has helped.

I've been down the whole list.  One side effect has been an allergic reaction at the point of application.  Local itching and redness under the patch and if left for the prescribed 24 hour period - blistering and skin seperation. I need the medication so I do the following.  I move the patch to a new location - tape it down with paper tape - every six hours and then only use it twelve hours a day.  Selegiline has a half life of three hours so I'm able to sleep eight of the twelve hours I'm not useing the patch.  A patch will last me two days. Even then I have minor skin damage that takes several weeks to heal.  But I have lots of skin area and just keep moving it around then I can come back and reuse a previously used area.  The Emsam/Selegiline medication has saved my life.

Hopefully, I will not experience any urinary retention like I have with Nardil after a six month period forcing me to discontinue that MAOI.My psychiatrist is going to try alternating between a 6mg. & a 9mg. patch on a every other day basis.
