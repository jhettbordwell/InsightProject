2$Anxiousness associated with Depression$5/5/2019 1:08:43 PM$Reviewer: LeeLee, 55-64 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$I previously took this medicine every day, along with my antidepressant which I have been taking for years.  I now only have to take alprazolam as needed, if I have anxiety, or trouble getting to sleep and it works great.  I guess if I wasn't on the antidepressant I would probably have to take the alprazolam daily.  But I have had no problems with alprazolam being addictive, ever.  It has helped me in the past when I've had severe anxiety attacks, and it now continues to help if I still have anxiety attacks, and problems getting to sleep.  I'm happy to have this med, and would recommend it to anyone needing relief from anxiety or sleeplessness, etc.

16$Anxiousness associated with Depression$12/28/2016 4:52:19 PM$Reviewer: thomasinjc, 55-64 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $4$5$4$I suffered from a brutal childhood and now with a diagnosis of PTSD, (Vietnam Vet.) I diagnosed by a board certified DO, and a psychiatrist who also agreed. With the addition of Elavil at bed time the nightmares a and daily morning severe anxiety, fear upon waking are very well controlled. As a Navy medic we used these med's which in most cases alleviated (permanently) all symptoms. Xanax was developed and marketed as a non addicting form of valium which is. In my experience I can now alleviate the pain of severe anxiety every morning. It may be psychologically addicting for some but that's it! I now live a more normal life than ever before going back all the way to my days in Vietnam. I wish more doctors would drop their bad opinions so that more people would not have to suffer!          
24$Anxiousness associated with Depression$6/2/2016 9:52:43 PM$Reviewer: Navillus 55, 75 or over on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$I have suffered from depression and anxiety since earliest childhood due to a physically abusive parent and then an extremely poor marriage.  I began taking Alprazolam in my early thirties for extreme tinnitus.  Now,  at age 78, I take a 75 mg. capsule of Effexor XR daily and one mg. tablets of Alprazolam three-to-four times daily as needed.  I can truly say this has been a life saver for me...  Once in a great while I have a mild panic attack, but I can lead an otherwise normal life.  I purchase the generic Effexor XR in Canada, but the Alprazolam is unbelievably inexpensive and I purchase it at a local pharmacy.

If you have any history of addiction or even a proclivity toward addiction, Xanax can be a death sentence. You tolerance increases, it becomes less effective and you require more and more until it's hard to separate if your anxiety is real or if your anxiety is related to when you will take your next Xanax pill. Now how depressing is that? VERY depressing. It's a downhill spiral. The pharmaceuticals LIE about the addictive nature of this drug. Please beware.

I have been on it for 25 years off and on again.  I have taken as much as 3mg daily, and as little as .5mg daily.  I can sleep at night when I take it.  Once when I had to take a brief break, my MD removed it all at once.  I was so nauseous that the world moved too fast spinning on its axis.  Now I taper off gradually.  No nausea.  It's not expensive.  90 1mg tabs generic without any insurance only costs about $14 monthly at my local pharmacy."

Without it, I would have been dead from extreme panic attacks, anxieties, nerves, including depression!!!
I DO NOT have an addictive personality, so taking this medication over a long period of time is not a problem... I have had to stop taking this med a few times in the past, and I've experienced no life threatening issues!  I do NOT recommend (as with any medication to stop taking it ""suddenly"" -that can negatively affect your health; mind & body)! Possibly creating extensive, serious side effects! DO NOT STOP TAKING THIS OR ANY SAME TYPE MEDICATION ""ONE DAY"" COMPLETELY!!! You must have your Dr. wean you off the medication over a good amount of time (months)!!! 
Overall, ""I'm still here & alive thanks to Xanax/Alprazolam,"" due to terrible, ""life threatening"" Anxieties, Panic Attacks, adding to depression from these attacks/nerves, etc., I've had since a late teenager after my special Grandfather passed on (first death I ever experienced,) and kids at school harassing me because I was a shy, good student!! After beginning this med I began working at my first job in a large, high profile, corporation!! Succeeding from a Marketing Assistant to the highest upper Management job/position in the Corporation!!! My anxieties/attacks were no longer controlling my life or rarely in my life any longer!  Thanks to Xanax/Alprazolam!!!
I'm VERY disappointed to now see more & more health insurance companies ""Not Covering"" this ""life saving & inexpensive"" medication anymore!!!??? For one, I just found out in 2013 Blue Cross ""PPO"" is NO LONGER COVERING XANAX/ALPRAZOLAM!?!?!?!?!  I'm disgusted with Blue Cross in their ""detrimental decision"" which will cause illnesses, some life threatening, to their customers & doctor's patients who can't afford another ADDED INSURANCE (non insurance covered expense) THAT WE PAY FOR IN OUR MONTHLY PREMIUMS ALREADY!!!!

I only take the alprazolam when I get anxious and that is usually when I'm reminded of things about my marriage and my children. If one 0.5 mg tab doesn't work I will take two and I'm allowed to take up to 6 tabs per day. I usually don't come near to that amount and do not use it every day. My doctor is very supportive and helpful and is satisfied with my way of using the drug even though it's not on a regular schedule. It does help me sleep when take at bedtime. Overall I am very satisfied with it and when the anxiety gets bad I thank God that I have it because nothing else gives me relief like alprazolam.

I have had chronic trouble sleeping for a long time, and had been telling my doc about my general anxieties. My dr. put me on .25mg of Alprazolam,nightly.  I've noticed that it REALLY helps me sleep the entire night-usually I'd have a hard time falling asleep/staying alseep.  I've been taking it for 2 months, with the exception of 1 day. When not on it, I tossed/turned instead of sleeping, and was a mess the next day-couldn't work.  This med relaxes me/helps me fall asleep & sleep all night.  Because I've only been on it for 2 mos, I am having some side effects-I am drowsy in the am; I'm noticing that I sleep about 9hrs/night, & still sleepy upon waking. I'm more tired through the day, and sometimes I don't want to do anything at all.  I do think about death; not suicide, but just different ways of dying. Gas, extreme thirst, confusion, dizziness, menstrual changes are the other effects I've been having.  But the flip side of this is that I sleep through the night-a good thing. I wonder if these effects will go away after I've been taking it for longer? Dr's had me on antidepressants a few yrs back, but it was only for a couple of mos @ a time, never long enough to determine their effectiveness. This is the 1st time in 3 yrs I've been on anything.  Overall, this drug helps me cope with the situations in my life.

I have always,since childhood, had anxiety,overwhelming moments that basically kept me from being able to get control of myself to calm down and focus.That which made me angry,quick to just lose self control on anyone anywhere. this medication was the best thing that basically ever helped me to be able to stop,think, and react as a ""normal"" person does.One crucial warning to everyone-It is not a miracle cure.Please only take as prescribed,NO MORE.!! If you take to many even a few times and you end up going completely without it can and WILL and DID cause seizures. I was driving when it happened to me.It wasn't just one seizure it was several. I did not kill or hurt anyone except for breaking my own back.Please be careful on this and all medications.Lesson learned-follow directions and take ONLY as your doctor prescribes.And DO NOT stop taking all at once. Let your Dr. take you off slowly. It is safer."

Xanax was a blessing. I was clear headed, not clouded or confused. It gave me my confidence back for work. However-there are drawbacks. This is VERY addictive. I'm on 1mg x4per day. But there are occasions (like most of you) you take more, some MUCH more. Those cause complete black outs. I remember nothing of what I was doing, even eating out with family and watching a movie. And withdrawls are brutal-NO cold turkey. Work with your doctor to wean off. I still take-with caution and control because they are the only ones that help me control my life and stay focused. Main word there-focused. But it's a fine line of wanting to take just to prevent an attack and just wanting to relax. Even if you think you are controlled be advised. But used properly it has brought my life back to me.

So I asked my doctor to prescribe the generic XR version, 1 mg. On the first day, I felt great!!! The drug worked wondered stablizing my panic/anxiety attacks (which are far and few between). I'm also taking a colon cleanser to counteract weight gain. After weighing myself this evening, the scale read 4 addtional pounds from my last weigh in which was yesterday morning. I've consumed healthy foods ALL DAY so I don't understand why I'm experiencing such a tremendous weight gain. I'm going to give Xanax XR a week.

Although he was hesitant, my doctor prescribed Alprazolam to try for a couple of weeks.  I'd have to say that it has been very effective.  I only take 1/2 of a .5mg pill when I feel the anxiousness coming on and within about 15 minutes I feel much calmer, yet not ""drugged"".  I can function normally throughout my work day and I feel it actually helps me concentrate better and be more productive.  I'm not saying this is a miracle drug, it has just helped me through getting over the holiday slump and depression."
