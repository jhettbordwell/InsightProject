150$Schizophrenia$12/12/2019 6:27:45 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $2$1$2$It takes any panic and puts it into a box outside of me and I feel like I can do anything normally. That last for 10-15 minutes and then I would get so dizzy I'd about fall over. Next my eyes will only want to roll into the back of my head and shake back and forth and I feel really stupid. Then I sleep for 5 hours and wake up not really remembering most of the day even though I went through it. But I didn't have the consciousness to be upset or disturbed?
171$Schizophrenia$5/15/2018 8:46:37 PM$Reviewer: RedFahee, 25-34 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$"Having a severe case of paranoid schizophrenia as well as debilitating manic depression (bipolar disorder) it was hard to function in daily life. 100mg in the morning, then 300mg before bed and I feel like a normal person again. No hallucinations, no voices, and not a bit of paranoia. I can sleep now and actually enjoy life like I NEVER have before. Absolutely amazing. The people that say it doesn't work or say they can't function on it only think they have the illness their doctor says they have. I have taken the same dose for 3 months and it's like nothing I've ever experienced. If you are using it so you can sleep...you are retarded. Period. It is an ANTI-PSYCHOTIC. Which helps people like me, and WILL cause mental problems for normal people. Ive seen it happen to 7 family members. Don't use this for sleep. And if you have trouble waking up of functioning while taking it STOP and switch doctors because you are not ill and you will develop problems. Otherwise, I'm thrilled to finally be ""right"" in the head again. "

I was unaware because I thought I was asleep and dreaming only to be told about the behaviour by my distraught partner at the time and sometimes waking up in a pool of blood from self inflicted cuts and gashes. I don't know how commonly this happens but be cautious.

Now I've cut down to 600mg and it's only like a band aid for me. There must be something better out there, when I was on 25mg Dexamphetamine and I felt much better than I do now it helped me way more than Seroquel.

254$Schizophrenia$4/25/2015 10:31:33 PM$Reviewer: rick, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$I'm sorry to read about the side effects some of you are having.  I've been on Seroquel for years & it works well for me.  Here are some tips for overcoming the most common side effects: if you have weight gain/constipation try using a laxative with prune juice, this should help get your bowels moving and you should be able to lose the weight you have gained; if you have dry mouth or blurred vision, try drinking more fluids and using lubricating eye drops; if you are overly sleepy during the day, try taking Seroquel before you go to bed instead. Also, I would not recommend skipping breakfast - ever.  Eating a good breakfast everyday will help you feel fuller throughout the day & you won't be as tempted to snack on sugary foods.  Most important, don't abruptly stop taking Seroquel without talking to your doctor first.  To do so could have disasterous consequences.  In my case, I would starting vomiting uncontrollably.  Maybe because of a drop in blood sugar?  Don't know.  I hope this helps with Seroquel's side effects.  Be well everybody.

kidney failure. It was extremely hard for him
to discontinue due to unpleasant side-effects. At one point he attempted suicide by over-dosing on Seroquel and was in ICU on a

But I began to lose muscle control, and mental control, and very quickly found myself being intubated, with my kidneys shutting down. Because several other drugs had been added to increase serotonin,I contracted Serotonin Syndrome. Scared the hell out of me, but I am recovering quickly.

1763$Schizophrenia$3/1/2009 6:47:23 PM$Reviewer: Zooid, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I have been on 1500 mg of Seroquel going on three years. I could not ask for a better treatment. I had an initial weight gain of about 15 pounds, which hasn't gone away. I take the full dose at bedtime. Within 45 minutes I am out and need at least 10 hours of sleep, or else I am so groggy that functioning for the day becomes difficult. About the second year in, my symptoms and minimal side effects began to recede exponentially. I haven't had problems with my blood sugar or have shown signs of diabetes. Constipation was a problem for a long time. One side effect that will not go away is that if I do not take the medication at night I cannot fall asleep and can literally be up for two days without feeling overly tired. So having a few doses in your car, at your friends houses, on you, and places of the like is important. If you miss doses there are noticeable spikes in symptoms that can last several days. Also keep drinking to a minimum. There has been a few times when I drank too much and had to stay in bed for about 15 hours before I had enough energy to crawl out of bed. There is also a very personal side effect with reduction of libido, sexual stimulation and production of semen. I had very weak orgasms paired with no ejaculation. I now have as regular bowel movements and orgasms as I ever had, with the exception that in the mornings, when the drug is still strong in my body, I cannot ejaculate. I am so grateful for this drug, it truly is a miracle. New users, know that it takes time for you to heal. Schizophrenia is a scary illness that tweaks the associations in your brain, it takes a while relearn reality by forging new synapses, Seroquel helped me rely more on facts than delusions and helps me think that my delusions are just that. If you have been on smaller doses for a while and your symptoms have receded little, ask for an increase, it will help. Rely on science and logic to identify your delusions and time and Seroquel will help them dissipate. God speed.

2341$Schizophrenia$2/10/2008 6:27:27 PM$Reviewer: bjr28, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$5$Although my psychiatrist loves this drug, I found it totally ineffective. Moreover, it gave me constant headaches, slow (but persistent) weight gain, and, perhaps most importantly, it made me sleep all day, which rendered my totally dysfunctional.  I have found Abilify (surprising, I know) and Zyprexa to be much better at treating the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, and, most importantly, allowing me to operate at a high level of functionality.  Given that all the anti-psychotics work differently, it's worth a try, but I have found Abilify and Zyprexa to be superior drugs.  In Seroquel's defense, however, I have heard that (for most people) the sleepiness wears off after a few weeks; it just didn't for me.  I would talk to your doctor and do some research about the other anti-psychotics (Abilify, Geodon, Risperdal, and Zyprexa) before taking Seroquel.  Lastly, be careful at first b/c you will not be able to drive or operate machinery &c. &c.

Her many years of not being treated for a multitude of psychotic behaviors while living alone (paranoia, racing thoughts, aggressive behavior, insomnia, delusions of granduer,etc.) has vastly improved with Seroquel and she became a rationale and caring human being and was able to sleep well for the first time in her life. She did gain weight, but was under-weight to start with, and has developed swallowing problems and has had to change her diet.Her doctor just stopped her dosage 2 weeks ago (cold turkey) after no negative symptoms presented, and she has just ended up in the ER and psychiatric unit at the hospital after becoming verbally and physically abusive to her caregivers and was removed from the facility kicking and screaming. The doctor has stated that he thought that since she was on such as low dose, she didn't need the medication anymore. We are investigating the whole situation, but are stunned that her doctor would remove her from the drug when she had been doing so well on it.

Works way better than abilify which I believe has questionable efficasy.

I started with one hundred mgs and now i take six hundred at night and two hundred in the morning. the doses get bigger the effects gets worse.I feel stuck between the living and the dead most of the time. Can't they come up with a more effective treatment then just making someone so tired that they have no reality.

2521$Schizophrenia$10/25/2007 12:09:19 AM$Reviewer: 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $1$1$5$"For me, Seroquel was added to my regimen when my schizophrenia began getting worse; my sleep at night ever more disturbed by general restlessness, anxiety, and persistent nightmares.

We began low and have been increasing it every appointment at 50mg each clip (Up to 350mg a day now).  To me, it's gotten too much out of hand and I feel like all I'm doing is eating some of those small ""dot"" candies (if anyone remembers those: they were colored hard dots of red, green, and blue stuck on a strip of semi-wax paper).

I really do not think this is working at all.  Nothing's getting better and some things are actually getting worse."

2536$Schizophrenia$10/18/2007 4:55:51 AM$Reviewer: 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $1$1$1$My doctor was afraid that my 30 year use of Haldol would produce uncontrollable facial movements.  She prescribed increasing doses of seroquel, ending at 200 mg per day.  After a few weeks I developed targives diskenesia with drastic lip and tonque thrusting as well as leg thrusting.  My wife reported this to the doctor who was sure that this would abate after I used seroquel for a period of time.  Luckily my wife looked up diskenesia on the web and found that it could become permanent.  After a few more weeks of symptoms she insisted that the doctor return me to haldol.  In a matter of days the Targive symptoms started to disappear.  I am no longer going to change my effective treatments for new drugs pushed by ill informed doctors.

2594$Schizophrenia$5/12/2018 9:05:39 PM$Reviewer: Eli Johnson, 25-34 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $3$1$3$I have been taking Seroquel for 17 years. I started taking seroquel 25mgs per day and now Im on 800mg seroquel xr per day. It puts me to sleep. I gained 10lbs or less in 17 years. I have developed gynecomastia and cant wear a t shirt without some people mentioning my gynecomastia. My prescribing doctor says I look emasculate and skinny. My other doctor says my gynecomastia is noticeable when I take my shirt off. My doctor recommended that I see a specialist to check for male breast cancer with ultrasound and mammogram and the test is covered by my insurance. The doctor said there were no cancer cells thefore surgery to remove the gynecomastia isn't covered by insurance. I cant afford to pay for the true gynecomastia surgery to remove the hard breast tissue.

2687$Schizophrenia$3/19/2012 9:06:12 AM$Reviewer: Jenyx, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $2$1$4$Was originally on 50mg of normal Seroquel but was switched to the slow release due to sleeping so much. Still sleepy but this has improved. Currently been a month on these and have been noticing for the past few days, on and off, that my heart is hurting, having chest pain and heart palpitations with dizziness. I was suffering with this before taking it (except dizziness), but now I'm constantly worrying about my heart, and I had no idea this could actually be the cause for this. I also told my doctor about my heart problems but apparently health doesn't matter to these people as long as you're on something. Will be contacting my doctor soon to try something else.

Problem is I sleep for many hours and feel like a zombie when I am awake. I wake up with dried blood around my mouth every morning. I still have mood swings and anxiety (with racing heart beat) and a bit of depression but the benifits outweigh the alternative to not taking this medication. I take 400 Mg once a day every evening. I also take an anxiety med and benedryl med everyday. Just wish I could function better physically when taking this medication.
