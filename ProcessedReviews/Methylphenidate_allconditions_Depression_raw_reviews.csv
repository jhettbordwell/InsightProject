5$Depression$12/22/2018 7:22:44 PM$Reviewer: Tbk , 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$4$5$"The only issue wity methylphenidate is increased anxiety. Despite having depression related to anxiety, I still advocate 100% for this drug. It saved my life. I just wish doctors would see it for what it is - my PCP views it as a dangerous drug that is only for recreational use when not used for ADHD. However my psychiatrist prescribed me Concerta 36mg (switched to methylphenidate SR due to financial reasons) and I haven't been happier. My anxiety is only worse when I'm not productive. But this medication allows me to be. It allows me to get out of bed in the morning. It allows me to shower and get dressed and clean my house. Of the 7 antidepressants I have been on in the past 2 years none have had such a profound effect. 

I truly hope more research is done so that people like myself are able to access the medication they need, despite it being off-label. I have no desire to abuse this drug when it has given me my life back. "

I nolonger cry because I have awaken to live another day I plan things with enthusisim and enjoy my alone time as well as time with friends and family non or witch I was able to do in the past.

I was severely depressed and on cymbalta and Geodon. My husband felt he was slowly losing me and that I would commit suicide, which is how I felt. I am living life now and can't stand to be in bed. I am just scared that it will stop being effective someday.  I take 2-10mg pills in the morning and keeps me going all day and the plus is that I have lost 10lbs this first month.I was ready to give up hope, until I took my own life in my hands and asked the doctor for specific meds. to try. First one was ADDERALL which didn't work. Then I asked for Rittalin which he happily gave me.  Now I don't even have to see him as much.My advice is research your own health, ask the doctors to keep prescribing different meds. until you get it right! Don't just accept it, fight for it ...it's your life!!

273$Depression$11/17/2008 6:50:43 PM$Reviewer: Steve R R, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $3$1$5$"AN OPTION for some:Methylphenidate is one of the pills the Docs put me on to help alertness during the day. NOTE: I do not have ADHA !. The alertness problem is probably caused by other meds along with a ""thing"" they call DEPRESSION. IMPORTANT: I WAS ON PROVIGIL FOR ABOUT A YEAR BEFORE MY INSURER PULLED IT.  Provigil maintained a steady, even, alertness (not a high) all day for me and wore off in the evening. I had very little insomnia . AND PROVIGIL DID NOT PRODUCE ADDITIONAL ANXIETY in my case.  Methylphenidate is to much like coffee, going up and down, up and down, and it's hard to find correct doses for an acceptable result. Also, my experience is that a TOLERENCE to Methylin occurs FAST. My Doctor warned me about this. A few times a month I radically lower the dose and go through some rotten withdrawal on purpose. Otherwise tolerence develops quickly over about 4-8 days and the methylphenidate's effectiveness, in my case would require increasing dosages(very bad news). With PROVIGIL, tolerance was negligible. If you are looking for that which helps alertness along with better concentration (how can one concentrate well when one is just about to fall asleep?)...if you can afford it, try to ask your Doc to let you try Provigil.  For me and my health situation PROVIGIL was far far superior to  METHYLPHENIDATE (AKA RITALIN), and if I could afford it, I would revert to Provigil and I am trying to find some $ to offset the cost differential.  My doctor agrees and actully apologized that I was going from that which worked very well, to an inferior med solution (FOR MY PARTICULAR CASE).

HEY OUT THERE ... May your health improve no matter what, and may we all arrive at a point where we need no pills or any medicine to thrive.

278$Depression$4/17/2008 2:47:49 AM$Reviewer: 13-18 Male  (Patient) $3$3$5$This has helped a lot with my focus issues and brought me success in school. It has helped me get through my depression but I it has limited other feelings.  For example, I cannot feel as excited as I used to or as nervious as I used to.  I can't decide if that's a good thing or a bad thing. I has had no help in terms of sleep. I still struggle with insomnia.

I didn't sleep for two days, my heart was pounding, and I felt drugged the entire time. It forces your brain to use up its neurotransmitters and then when you stop you crash. It is so odd that everyone knows that meth amphetamine is bad for you but if your doc writes an Rx for a stimulant drug like this then it is okay? 
329$Depression$3/31/2015 8:06:10 AM$Reviewer: Doc House, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$4$4$"I am suffering from bipolar 2 (or 3) disorder with predominantly severe atypical depressive episodes. I.e. most of the time I suffer from lack of energy as the most important symptom, especially after the induction of a severe episode through burn out. Other symptoms are anxiety, indifferentism, anhedonia, hypersomnia and raised appetite. My body feels just weak and there are many signs of Fatigue or neurasthenia. My level of functioning is significantly disturbed by this state. I also feature one suicide attempt. Regarding personality, anancastic traits and high performance demands on my own are remarkable, that brought me many times high success in education and job.
For over 10 years now, I take antidepressants, tried almost all without getting it to a true remission. Now, I take Venlafaxine 150 mg, Reboxetine 8 mg, Tilidin/Naloxone ret. 100/8 mg (! helps ! with dose remains stable), and Ritalin adult 40 mg/d + Ritalin 10 mg Tbl. 2x/d (60 mg/d). 
It is very helpful and effective in the treatment of my predominant symptoms of fatigue/neurasthenia and helps very good for me to get work effectively done. I have take care of dosage as my brain is different sensitive to Ritalin from time to time. There is a dependency one can handle by slow down-tapering from time to time. I take it half a year now. Side effects are sometimes ugly, as in a dose dependent manner, it is possible that I suffer from acoustical hallucinations (hearing voices) that only can be treated by diazepam effectively (no antipsychotic works here).
Overall, 15 years trial and error and multiple in-house treatment in renowned clinics didn’t work well until I am on the above mentioned medication. It gave me stability in my very demanding and ambitious work environment without having many days of absence due to my illness. "

Have tried numerous combinations of medications after episodes of cutting and suicidal thoughts.  Finally, my physician prescribed me Ritalin to take twice a day that I take along with Effexor XR 150.  I feel better than I have in a LONG time!  My coworkers and family have also noted a huge change in my mood and attitude! I no longer go home from work in the evenings and crash on the couch from exhaustion like I used to.  I have so much more focus, which doesn't allow my mind to wander to things that cause anxiety.  The only issue I had was some extreme restlessness, like restless leg syndrome, but in arms at night time.  My doctor prescribed me 1-2 milligrams of Klonopin to take before bed and the restlessness has completely gone away! I can't say enough about how Ritalin has improved my quality of life.  I still have down days, but they come a lot less often now!

The only down side I have seen thus far is a bad pounding headache that Tylenol doesn't seem to help either.  Will talk to my doctor to see if it is a side effect of the meds or something else because the headaches are pretty bad.  I haven't seen a whole lot of comments from others saying headache was a symptom so...maybe it's just coincidental.  Would love to stay on the meds because the my energy and focus level have sky rocketed.

I tried lots of different meds but none worked well. I finally started a combination of Trazadone and Welbutrin, while this helped some I still felt that something was missing, still felt lethargic, and still working on the depression. Worst of all the Welbutrin caused me to become mentally unfocused, and my mind was wandering constantly. It was, however the only drug that had helped me at all. I then was prescribed Ritalin in addition to those. Wow is it exactly what I had needed. I have been able  to keep my focus, able to have enough energy to get through a standard day and not want to hide from the world. For the first time, I have actually been feeling good. I honestly feel like I have found a miracle combination for what was troubling me. I have noticed no negative side effects. the only down side is that after about 6 hrs or so of taking it I begin to feel a slow down, or crash. As if I hadnt taken it at all. I intend to see if I can spread it out through the day. but other than that it really has been fantastic for me.

The drug itself may fall into the ""bandaid"" category of treatments, as opposed to your atypical SSRI anti-depressants, but I would not consider it to be overly addictive neccessarily, such as is generally the case with Xanax and other benzodiazepines.  Quite honestly....to sum it up....Ritalin has the ability to restore a hapless depression patient to full, lucid cognetive abilities, and even enhance such capabilities beyond societies accepted ""norm."""
