0$Depression$6/5/2012 10:21:38 AM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$This medication has been a godsend, it has kept me sane & helped me sleep for over 15 years. I have suffered from depression my entire adult life & spent a decade trying everything with limited success. I hated sleeping all my life as I have horrible nightmares & sleepwalk. It's hard to say how much of the depression was a result of insomnia, but whatever the reasons this has really helped. I am reassured by the fact that it has been around for over 50 years.

I tried different anti-depressant drugs before Tofranil PM.  None worked.  Once I started taking Tofranil PM I could ""feel"" my spirits lift.  The change came within 30 days.  It was an incredible feeling.  I was depressed and also had panic attacks.  I couldn't leave my home.  I was living in hell. This drug was my lifesaver.  I tried different times to get off the drug but I would return to .  There is something lacking in me that this drug keeps me on an even keel.  Now that I am on Medicare, my prescription drug plan does not cover this drug.  It is going to cost me almost $5000 a year to continue taking this drug.  Without it, I am not myself. Why should prescription drug plans tell you what drug you need when they don't have a clue about past experiences with the drug?"

I have been taking Tofranil-PM for over 20 years and it has saved my quality of life.  I had severe depression and anxiety attacks that kept me at home.  I think I would have committed suicide if I had not found help."

A young doctor, just out of medical school, told me he thought I had biological depression and asked me to try Tofranil. In about a week I was no longer depressed. I have tried to get off the drug several times but each time I get down to 150mg my depression starts up again.
I am now 70 years old and maintain on 200mg at bedtime. I have no sign of depression and have appropriate reactions. My life would not be worth living without Tofranil. The few side effects I have are a small price to pay. This drug has saved my life."

20$Depression$11/3/2007 7:26:11 PM$Reviewer: Daddy MIke, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$I suffered with panic disorders for nearly 14 years before I sought treatment.  After six months on this drug I was almost back to normal.  Combined with two years of therapy, I could function normally.  I have been on this drug for nearly 20 years with no side effects. This drug has been a life saver for me.
40$Depression$4/13/2014 10:26:37 PM$Reviewer: Cay, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $4$4$4$Imipramine has given me long term relief from depression, having taken it for 18 years. I started treatment with SSRI's then later my dr. added imipramine, then did SSRI's alone, but it only worked for only about 5 years, making depression worse at the end. Took imipramine along and had better results with tri-cyclic.

65$Depression$1/13/2012 9:18:43 PM$Reviewer: JDH, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $3$2$5$Imipramine worked well in the beginning, especially with sleeping.  However, within a year, my dosage had been increased to the highest mg available.  It seemed to loose its potency after a few months.  I ended up switching to another.

86$Depression$8/6/2010 8:59:41 PM$Reviewer: kitkat, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$1$5$Both times i took this drug i eventually had to go to the hospital for severe abdominal pain. I didn't know for sure it was the immipramine because i was not told ab pain was a side effect. the drug worked wonders for my depression, ADHD and sleep. I experienced the usual side effects of dry mouth, bad constipation, sensetivety to the sun and heat (i burned way easier) as well as the not so common side effect of severe abdominal pain.

100$Depression$11/20/2009 10:46:20 AM$Reviewer: mercymee, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I had suffered with anxiety and depression for many years on and off.  Then during a very difficult time I no longer could manage.  I started taking this med.  It took about 3 months before I received the full benefit.  I was on this drug from 1994 until 2003 (I was afraid to go off of it).  I have never gone back to depression and crippling anxiety like I had before taking imipramine.  It is now 6 years since my last dose... I feel as though I was thrown a life line... life is good!

104$Depression$7/26/2009 11:30:49 AM$Reviewer: homegirl, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$This is the only antidepressant that has ever worked for me. I have tried all of the SSRIs with negative result. I am currently on 75mg a day. I don't like the bad taste in my mouth or the sweating or constipation; however I am willing to deal with them. I take stool softener and drink lots of water, wear light clothing, and use breath mints/breath spray. I was very, very depressed. Imipramine has been a godsend for me.
105$Depression$7/26/2009 3:51:06 AM$Reviewer: none, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$4$5$I've been using this drug most of the time since 1981. Without it, I'm barely functional because of depression. I've tried other anti-depressants, eg. Prozac, Paxil, but they don't do the job as well. I'm currently taking 150 mg @ bedtime. Side effects are unable to tolerate extreme heat/humidity combination, excessive sweating under those conditions, and if I forget to dose, I feel like crap the next day, and have little (brain tweeks?) of and on through the day, but can correct these if I half dose in the morning.
112$Depression$4/29/2009 4:32:14 PM$Reviewer: stokcarr2, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$4$5$My GP prescribed this for me to take at bedtime so that I would have a better night's sleep and wake up feeling refreshed (and also for mild depression). As far as my sleep goes, it doesn't really help me sleep any better (doesn't make it worse either), but I do wake up feeling well-rested. The best part about it? For me, it has decreased my appetite so much that I haven't eaten a meal in 4 days (I just started taking it a week ago). I have to force myself to eat a cracker or a piece of bread just so I have something in my stomach. I have lost 7 pounds in a week!! I know it's not the best way to lose weight, but why fight it? I need to lose 25 pounds anyway! I don't know if it actually helps with depression, but if I lose 25 pounds I probably won't be so depressed anymore.
113$Depression$3/24/2009 12:43:51 AM$Reviewer: Patricia RN, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Caregiver) $1$1$1$I asked the doctor to take me off of this med.  I had ringing in my ears, acne, hair loss,wt. gain, dizziness,bad taste in my mouth,urine retention, and urinary tract infection, unable to focus on problems,memory loss.  It did not help the depression.
116$Depression$12/6/2008 10:23:55 PM$Reviewer: anonymous, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$I have taken this drug for a number of years and I am quite satisfied with it.  My doctor prescribed other meds to replace this but I noticed nothing else was as effective and this med.  
121$Depression$2/16/2008 11:30:22 PM$Reviewer: onyx, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Caregiver) $1$1$1$"My husband took this medication at the age of 10-12. He started having auditory and visual halusinations. Tremors of the hands and legs. And many other problems. He was taken off the medication. He is 29 now. But after this medication, he never lost the ""voices and visuals"" nor the tremors. Because of the voices and visuals. He is now ""schizophrenic"". His doctor said these will never go away. Please dont put your children on this medication!"
124$Depression$12/4/2007 5:32:03 PM$Reviewer: Jason, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $3$3$3$ I was taking 75mg a day to help with Bipolar Disorder/ADHD along with 54mg Concerta and 100mg of Seroquel. I stopped taking this medication several months ago with mixed feelings due to side effects I felt threatened my health. I do feel abit down and compulsive without it though. I delt with major constipation, excessive sweating, a strange metallic taste in my mouth, and a huge decrease in urine output. It was as if my body would no longer tell me I needed to go. It gave me a big sweet tooth.

133$Depression$1/16/2014 8:32:46 PM$Reviewer: trainwreck54, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $4$4$5$Imipramine has worked better than anything else for my serious psychiatric problems. I've been on it most of my life. The imipramine pamoate formulation seems to smooth out the side effects-tremor and dry mouth especially. The old tricyclic antidepressants have the spectrum of action of the new SNRIs and are much cheaper.

138$Depression$1/6/2011 7:02:33 PM$Reviewer: Jaime, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $2$1$3$"A couple years ago, I was given this as an addition to my zoloft.  I tried it for a couple weeks, but I couldn't stay on it.  I don't remember whether it helped my anxiety or depression, but I remember the side effects.

My muscles felt like I had the flu.  They would get fatigued very quickly.  They other thing is that my memory was totally shot.  I couldn't recall simple words that I use all the time.  I know that happens to everyone once in a while, but this was extreme.  It would happen 5 times in the same conversation.  I'd have to stop in the middle of a sentence and try to explain the definition of the word to the person I was speaking to.

May be a great for someone else, but it just didn't work for me."
