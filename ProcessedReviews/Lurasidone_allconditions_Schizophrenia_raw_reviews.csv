I ended up on a mental ward because of this medication. I was only on this medication for two weeks at best. I would never perscribe this medication to anyone ever!!

13$Schizophrenia$5/5/2019 1:27:09 AM$Reviewer: Sitacat, 45-54 on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$3$4$I take latuda for schizoaffective disorder. I started on 40 felt great. But then had an episode. Was put up to 80. Had severe anxiety, sleeplessness and nightmares for a month. The nightmares ended at one month but the anxiety remained and i have to take medication to control that and help me sleep. I now take seroquel, melatonin and mianserin for the side effects. They are all in low doses but I have to take them. Now I feel good and itâ??s working for me. I have lost 23 kgs since being on zyprexa in 12 months. So that has been really good. Latuda has really good qualities but I have found managing the side effects difficult. If you donâ??t take good with the tablet you may also get very nauseous. Overall it has cleared my head.

57$Schizophrenia$2/15/2016 3:55:48 PM$Reviewer: martinhersey, 65-74 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$3$3$I started on Latuda about four years ago. It is a reasonably good AP with a minimum of side effects. Of course, as with any AP, you have some sedation, esp. at higher dosages. It does not do anything with my auditory hallucinations.

76$Schizophrenia$8/6/2015 10:01:06 PM$Reviewer: Ratherbesafe, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $3$1$4$Latuda helped with my thought disorders however I gained 60 lbs, had very cholesterol, extreme fatigue, enlarged breasts (from B to D), and now my jaw is doing what it wants- stays in a protruding state unless I forcefully pull it back so now I look somewhat like I have Downs Syndrome. Wish I never used it because side affect seem to be permanent as I stopped taking it 6 months ago. Better just be crazy then deal with all that too.
166$Schizophrenia$2/27/2014 10:26:42 PM$Reviewer: lynn, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$3$I take Xanax a lot but was still having weird thoughts and panic at times. I just started taking Latuda it has been a great experience. I feel it hit then it dimishies but it keeps me up all night. It doesn't make me sleepy. I have not been on it long and I am not a big eater so taking it with food is hard for me.it gives me a dry mouth as well in the morning. I have some dominate eye twitching since I started it but its not worth stopping it over an eye twitch. overall its the best medication I have been on since I was a teenager. I have taken all sorts of psychiatric drugs so this and Xanax has been a life saver. I just hope it gets cheaper because it is quit expensive right now.
179$Schizophrenia$2/9/2014 12:52:31 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $2$1$3$Been on Latuda for two days and hate it. I have no appetite. The doctor had me take it with dinner and have the worse restlessness and constant need to move around. I get no sleep, horrible vivid nightmares. Feeling bloated. Seen no visible improvements. Not taking it again until I can speak with my doctor. 
181$Schizophrenia$2/1/2014 1:23:27 PM$Reviewer: 123456, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$1$1$I have been on 40mg of Latuda for 3 months and developed intolerable side effects including insomnia, dizziness, dystonia, restless legs syndrome, weight gain, uncontrollable mood swings, headaches, and TD. Discontinued it and suffered from withdrawl effects for several months. Would not recommend Latuda to anybody.
202$Schizophrenia$10/27/2013 11:48:32 AM$Reviewer: Kathy, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Caregiver) $2$1$3$"My 37 year old son, living with us-his parents, having Bipolar/late onset Auditory Schizophrenia was prescibed Latuda. It appeared to be working for the initial period - 3 weeks. Still having extreme auditory halluciations 24-7, the dose was increased slighty. He began having panic attacks- It was right before the New Year, so doctors were not available. I was able to help him through these daily attacks-- breathing etc. After 5 days,
he took his own life -shot himself with a hunting rifle. He had always said he would not or could not do this to us. Apparently, this either gave him the courage to do so, or it just was not working for him and he could not live with this anymore. It was no fault of anyone and I can understand why he did it so there was no anger. I just wanted to report that maybe this med needs to have doctor monitoring check-ins after 3 days of increasing a dose. I hope that we invest more money in research for the causes of mental illness instead of finding ""quick resolve"" by trying all meds the minute they are available. The switching of one drug and abrubtly changing to another MUST affect the brain chemistry. If drug companies care about the individual, instead of the money, they would consider ALL side effects and HIGHLY emphasize the extreme risks of suicide. Sometimes, the patient does not state nis/her feelings inside-- even to his ""soul mate""-me- his mother! Greiving such a loss is the ultimate saddness."

Started with 20 mg and going all the way up to 120 per doctors orders. Sleep more soundly and feel more rested. Able to cry again and feel normal. Just started 40 mg today. Not doing anything to mentally challenging while doing dosage changes. 
212$Schizophrenia$9/7/2013 12:16:42 AM$Reviewer: 45-54 Female  (Caregiver) $1$1$5$My daughter has bipolar 1 and schizophrenia and it did nothing for her. She started on a low dose and immediately went to 120 which didn't make a difference in her life at all.  She still was distracted with voices, and racing thoughts.  Didn't help or hurt her sleep. She was taking it with Seroquel. She still struggled with same symptoms as the last 7 years.  Almost no difference, and made her condition a little worse it seemed. We are trying something new now.  As I mentioned in another review, we have discovered after reading many reviews on line from all drugs.... due to chemical imbalance nature, one is a Godsend for one person is the worst nightmare for another when it comes to anti-psychotic, bipolar, schizo-affective meds in general.

Mania went away but I'm afraid I'm getting depressed. No more voices. Thinking clearer. Liked 40mg of Zyprexa better but gained too much weight and blood sugar. Blood test coming soon. Think I lost a few lbs.
231$Schizophrenia$4/25/2013 12:58:46 PM$Reviewer: YC, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$3$5$"I am a 38 year old male who since childhood experienced schizoaffective symptoms but never received a consistent teatment. In the past I received paxil, xanax and even colonopin; all of which had very negative side effects. I recently decided to try again as my symptoms have gotten too difficult to cope with. My Dr. prescribed Latuda and here are my results so far: 

*1st two weeks 20 mg tablets resulting in less depression, more controllable sense of reality when alone (social settings still triggered psychosis) and longer sleep although with horrific nightmares. Side effects I felt were stiffness in my knees, pain in my lower back, emotional dullness, stomach ache and nausea

*following 2 weeks 40 mg tablets resulting in 
further lessened depression, lessened psychotic experiences when alone, a better sense of control.Side effects were longer sleep but with horrific nightmares, heat sensitivity, pain and stiffness in joints, nausea, stomach ache, emotional dullness, slower movement 

*2nd month Dr. increased dosage to 80 mg. Everything seemed the same as before with the exception of deeper sleep and weight gain (metabolism change). The next thing that happened was a disaster of which I am recovcering right now. I went to the beach and got sunburned, was never told of any complications with sun exposure nor did I read anything on Latuda's site. I woke up the next morning with multiple wounds on my scalp discharging yellow fluid. My head and face have swollen up to such an extent I look disfigured. I went to the emergency room and more than $4000 of tests later everything was 'normal'. The physician could only attribute it to the medication's photo reactivity.  I went to my Dr. again today to show her my condition (which hasn't changed but gotten worse- for over 24 hours now) she also surmised it must be the photo reactivity, reduced my dosage back to 40mg and recommended I stay out of the sun.

Hope this info helps anyone considering using Latuda"

258$Schizophrenia$10/4/2012 4:31:49 PM$Reviewer: MeaganLove, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$I have had difficulty with other antipsychotics and the metabolic disorder.  Latuda has enabled my cholesterol and blood sugar to drop back to nearly normal.  I am eating extremely healthy and have lost 10 pounds over a month.  I have been on Latuda 40 mg for 2 months.  My sleep schedule has been through many cycles, from at first not sleeping at all and pacing, to sleeping all day, and now I am finally sleeping 7 hours a day and higher functioning but at the wrong time (5 am to 12 pm).  Latuda has improved my memory and cognitive function to a level i never experienced in my life.  My delusions, which were severe about the mafia  stalking me, are gone and I am even in graduate school AND beginning my own art studio.  Saphris caused my triglycerides to be 1000 and Invega caused my blood sugar to be 500.  Abilify caused my body to jerk horribly as i tried to sleep.  Latuda has seen me through all metabolic syndrome healing and my body doesn't jerk.  So far I give Latuda a 15 out of 10!

Had to stop owing to tardive dyskenesia side effect.  Have continued with Wellbutrin 300xl. Latuda: began with 20mg--no effect; at 40mg, the benefits, after a little over a month, have been amazing and life-saving.  I am thinking about upping dosage to 60mg but am very ok with 40.  Virtually no side-effects.

276$Schizophrenia$7/18/2012 7:46:05 PM$Reviewer: Colorado B, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$4$5$I started taking Latuda after being diagnosed with Bipolar I/Schizophrenia.  Beforehand, I had tried Risperdal, which made me very emotional (and gave me stomach fat) and Seroquel which made me a zombie.  Latuda has worked amazingly on my conditions, although it took 6-8 weeks to fully suppress my abnormal thoughts and feelings (even though it took only 2 weeks to begin combatting my concomitant sleep maintenance insomnia).  My only concern is that I've been taking it with Lamictal and, after 3.5 months, my liver diagnostics look badly off the charts.  I am tapering off the Lamictal to see if Latuda alone does not cause this.  Wish me luck.

It's a 'done'.  Ilperidone, risperdone were my worst drugs.  My best drug was Loxipine, so similarly my other two best drugs should be asenepine and clozapine.  but, they already messed up clozapine because I'm stuck on the sleep aid temazepam, and can't take the two together.

My doctor explained this med is similar to Abilify which scares beyond words. I took Abilify for approx. 3 months and had serious side-effects. I had to be hospitalized for those side-effects. I am afraid to take this new med but I am also tired of constantly feeling like life is passing me by. I am losing life. I no longer know what happiness is. I don't want to jeopardize my life trying new meds but I need something to work. Hopefully this, Latuda, is the one that will give me my life back, with God's help of course.
