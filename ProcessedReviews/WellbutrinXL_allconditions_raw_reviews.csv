1$Condition: Stop Smoking$8/29/2019 7:42:21 AM$Reviewer: KGL, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$I started taking bupropion XL 150mg 6 days ago for smoking cessation and anxiety.  I am a 29yo female in good physical health. I read all the reviews about how it effects people with anxiety but I wanted to give it a try. LET ME TELL YOU: I do not recommend this medicine for anyone with legitimate anxiety or panic disorders. I was fine for the first 2 days and then I just started crying about things that normally didn’t make me cry. I chalked it up to hormones being I was approaching a certain time of the month. By day four I was just laying on the couch and had thIs deep feeling of sadness. I tried to push through anyway. Last night, however, I was inconsolable and had the worst anxiety I’ve had in months. I was terrified, sweating, crying, my heart was racing, and I felt like everything was crumbling around me. My thoughts were dark and I couldn’t talk myself down-which I usually can. None of my coping mechanisms worked and all I could do was wait for it to pass. On top of the fact that I never once felt the urge to not smoke! I stopped taking this medication this morning. I know medicine effects everyone differently and this is my first ever experience with an  antidepressant but jeez. I would rather quit smoking cold turkey than deal with this nonsense. It was like I took ten steps back taking this medicine. I’m glad to see and hear that it really helps some people and sometimes it’s worth pushing through and giving it a try. However, if you don’t suffer from depression or even have very mild depression I feel there are probably better options out there. This should not be the first course of action for people with anxiety and honestly, I blame my doctor for totally bypassing the fact that it is not recommended for anxiety sufferers in the first place. I wish everyone good luck and hope this helps so that other people like me don’t have to suffer.
2$Condition: Binge Eating Disorder$6/8/2019 9:06:45 PM$Reviewer: Francesca, 45-54 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$So far so good. Felt a little weird and sick to the stomach the first week but now after one month I feel more normal with out the constant urge to find something to eat and I started a diet when I started taking it and its the first time in 4 years I've been able to stick to my diet without loosing control and having a carb/sugar fest. Lost almost 8 pounds in a month so I'm sticking to this. It also helps my PTSD by letting my brain rest and not running the same thing through my mind over and over. Stress seems to be lower. Social anxity still there but I'm a introvert by nature so not planning on being the life of the party any time soon either way.

5$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$4/7/2019 1:21:09 AM$Reviewer: Kat , 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$3$5$It has made my anxiety much worse, and I’ve developed some sort of ‘OCD’. But, on that note, I do seem a bit more motivated. I’ve been on other meds for awhile and have been ‘numb’ since, so I’m not sure how this affected it, other than not making it any better.

Other meds SSRIs had disastrous results. Good for increasing or restoring dopamine. Little to no bad sexual effects. Been on it 11+ years now retired 10 yrs. Lifesaving med for me.

8$Condition: Depression$1/4/2019 11:44:46 AM$Reviewer: teechur, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$3$5$"I started on Bupropion to deal with my depression after I'd lost a lot of interest in a lot of things I'd previously loved like running, competing, exercise, etc. I was crying a lot for no reason, and my previous good self esteem was in the toilet. It really helped with the crying, but it increased my anxiety dramatically and I'd never had anxiety before. I also feel it made my emotions very ""flat"". So instead of crying all the time I was having very few emotions even when I should be. I went from a formerly bubbly, motivating person (prior to the depression) to a quiet, withdrawn person who was too afraid to go outside and run and running has been my life for 15 years. I'm going to talk to my doctor about reducing the dose. "
9$Condition: Depression$1/3/2019 10:05:42 AM$Reviewer: guigeek, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$I have been taking Bupropion HCI XL 300 mg for about 10 years.  It is the only medication that works for me with the least amount of side effects (dry mouth and itching). I do take an allergy pill as well. I don't walk around crying for no reason or get upset over little things. I don't have thoughts of wanting to die anymore.  I quit smoking, cold turkey, 3 years ago and have remained a non-smoker.  This drug has been great for me.
10$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$10/15/2018 4:42:39 PM$Reviewer: SC-Scribe, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$1$The drug screwed up my sleep cycle, and so taking it was very difficult. I wanted to give it a fair shake on the ADD, so kept at it. Then I developed odd neurological tingling / twitches in my fingers. Didn't associate it with the drug. THEN, a horrible neurological condition struck, and I was rushed to the hospital. It was hypokalemia -- low potassium -- and it was life-threatening. Bupropion, as it turns out, is associated with this. Ironically, my business partner's boyfriend was a few months later taking it for smoking cessation; she had to drive him to the hospital for the same reason. So just be aware!
11$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$10/12/2018 4:46:43 PM$Reviewer: Wednesday, 25-34 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$I was initially prescribed 21 tablets of Bupropion XL 150 mg to take every morning for 3 weeks for depression and nicotine addiction. During the first week I felt much more energetic and somewhat euphoric at times. I also noticed my nicotine cravings begin to dissipate and I began having vivid dreams every time I went to sleep. In week two I had no nicotine cravings at all, but I started having frequent panic attacks and crying spells. By week 3 I was actively suicidal, and my prescriber discontinued my course of treament with this medication. It has only been one day since I stopped taking Bupropion and I feel like my normal depressed self again which I welcome back with open arms as opposed to the extremely emotional and impulsive version. I feel less focused and a little bereaved, but not unbearably so. On a positive note, the thought of smoking a cigarette or vaping nicotine is revolting to me. I hope it stays that way. 
12$Condition: Other$9/12/2018 7:11:28 AM$Reviewer: 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$"18 years ago, when I was 22-ish, i started taking zoloft, and that was effective but it kind of made me feel dull.  So, after maybe 6-8 years I stopped taking zoloft.  
A couple years later, I started taking Adderall, and that allowed me to focus and not feel dull and still ponder my existence all at the same time.  
Several years later, I grew concerned about the long term effects of my elevated blood pressure, so I stopped taking adderall.
A couple years later, I heard of this alternative and determined to try it.
I have now been taking bupropion for two to four years.  
It does not seem to either inhibit or improve my focus (I have always been a fairly focused person), perhaps I fidget a wee bit less.  
Most importantly - I am able to execute my responsibilities for my work and family; I don't feel otherwise affected; my moods are my own; my thoughts are various and normal, as are my interactions with and reactions to ""people"" - although my stress levels still rise to unsustainable heights, I have worked on mindfulness to always be aware that I choose how to respond to every situation.

as a note, I have only ever taken the minimum dose for all of these drugs, with one exception when my doctor recommended upping the zoloft dosage- the increase had no noticeable effect on me."
13$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$7/8/2018 3:15:36 PM$Reviewer: diane, 65-74 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $4$3$4$I take this med, 300mg every morning. I have been using it for 16 yrs. I also take Trintllex, Lamotrigine, and Trazadone. I was in intensive care for three and a half days. I have been suicidal and in the hospital many times. About a week ago I accidentally stopped taking it. Yesterday I took it and was drugged and sleeping for six hours. I could barely get up. Has anyone had this happen.? It is not listed as a side affect.
14$Condition: Bipolar Depression$5/23/2018 8:43:59 PM$Reviewer: 55-64 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$I am bipolar Type 2. I have been on bupropion for at least 15 years. It has been a Godsend for me. Without it, I lack motivation. It has allowed me to live a very successful and fulfilling life. (It also helps keeps your weight down). The downside is that you feel pretty awful if you miss a dose, but I make sure that seldom happens. Not for everyone, I know.You need to eat while taking it. Can cause involuntary jerks and tardic dyskinesia (muscles work slower than your brain) if you donÃ¢Â?Â?t.  I also take gabapentin, which helps eliminate seizures, so I suppose they balance each other out. Also can affect your balance if you arenÃ¢Â?Â?t hydrated. But all this is worth it to me. You learn how to deal with it. Hope this helps!

I have extreme joint pain in my thighs, arm & thumb.  I am currently in the process of tapering off of Bupropion.  I am wondering if anyone else has had similar muscle / joint pains that have stopped & how long it took for you to feel normal again.  I am miserable!!
16$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$11/27/2017 11:25:45 PM$Reviewer: DesignerType, 45-54 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$"Bupropion has literally saved my life.  I didn't want to live before I started taking it.  I have been taking it for 17  years now.  The few side effects it has go away after about six weeks of taking it.  At first I was a bit shaky, had mild headaches, slight insomnia.  These side effects went away, but even if they didn't go away they were more tolerable than depression.  The brand name (Wellbutrin) works better than the generic (Bupropion) but unless you have $16,000 - $18,000 per year to spend you better use generic. (I'm not exaggerating this price)  Another tip:   I have found with the generic it's best to use the 100 mg three times per day vs. the 300 mg XL one time per day.  The generic XL (extended release) does not work for me.  It took me literally years to figure this out so...you're welcome.  :)   "
17$Condition: Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity$11/11/2017 1:00:59 PM$Reviewer: DB, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$5$4$Doctor gave me this to help with the anxiety that is caused by my ADHD/ADD until I could get in to see a psychiatrist. Must say it has worked wonders. The first day, it released the ADD and actually made it worse. Think of taking chains (anxiety) off the disease and letting it run wild. The second day was better. Noticed a little irritable at common tasks throughout the day. The third day, I was completely normal. I had motivation to get things done and haven't had any desire to procrastinate. The ADHD and ADD is still there and I can notice it but it doesn't make me anxious about it.

I am married  25 years my husband is not supportive, however, I have an excellent  psychologist.  I was relieved when I received a diagnostic of Bipolar Disorder, now I know what is ""wrong"". I am takin 75mg 3 pills daily, I  see some improvement. I am reaching out  attempting to socialize. I recently obtained a part time   teaching position. I am looking forward to resuming  activities I had stopped, art projects, I don't think about death and dying as much as I once did. I have lost weight. I don't drink because when I do I feel awful. I cannot tolerate loud noises, I attend church, and I am moving forward with my life and living.  Trying hard to remain in the present."

I have a history of depression and recently diagnosed with AdultADD. I did begin to notice a lil less procrastination more motivated to do at least 1 task. My moods have been upbeat more often. I smoke cannabis so my urge for that has decreased. Although, 3rd day in I woke up with the most painful headache stemming from last night. I thought if I sleep on it; then it will go away in the morning. It hasn't. To b cont'd.

I feel better, but I'm sure it will get even better than before.  My lower back started aching within 24 hours and I'm hoping this subsides.  I will tell my doctor in 3 weeks, but I see there are others with this symptom.
21$Condition: Depression$3/29/2017 4:45:48 PM$Reviewer: meggie, 55-64 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$3$3$I had been on Lexapro 10 mg once daily.  I had lost my mother and brother within nine months of each other.  I was devastated.  My husband suffered a spinal cord injury at our summer vacation at ocean city in 2011.  I have been getting worse. My doctor prescribed bupropion 150 sr once daily two weeks ago in addition to the Lexapro. I have only been taking 75 mg as I have reactions to certain drugs.   I feel better during the day but still experience anxiety every morning.  I like to have an alcoholic drink but feel it does not agree with the bupropion.  Any advice would be so helpful. 
22$Condition: Depression$2/7/2017 10:24:41 AM$Reviewer: goodvibes, 19-24 on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$5$5$I am very new to anti-depressants but after my anxiety attacks and depression getting out of control my doctor suggested them. I was on Zoloft for months but my sex drive went way down. My doc then put me on 300mg of Burpropion. I have been on it for about six months and the results are amazing. I feel like my normal self again and my sex drive also went back to normal. I had a little chunk before but I lost it all totaling 35 lbs of weight loss. I feel amazing. I am diagnosed with Depression and PTSD so for me this medicine did the trick! 
23$Condition: Depression$1/21/2017 12:26:54 PM$Reviewer: DEC, 45-54 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$"This drug saved my life, and probably my marriage. I have experienced no side effects whatsoever. I started on 150mg time release two years ago, and after six months increased to 300mg time release. I take it early every morning once per day, but do not find that it has any effect my ability to sleep. One artifact of taking Bupropion is that I can no longer drink alcoholic beverages without feeling awful, so I have quit drinking completely. This is probably for the best, as before I started using this medication, I drank heavily for 20 years in an attempt to ""self medicate"" my depression. Even though I still love the taste, I have no desire to drink anymore - I'm much happier living without depression than I ever was getting drunk. It seems a small price to pay for the miracle that it has performed in my brain chemistry. I still feel down and sad from time to time, but now it's because I have a reason for it, like people with normal brain chemistry. You're supposed to have mild depressed feelings when bad things happen, and so I've learned to distinguish between these feelings and the depression I lived with most of my life. I have more energy, am more motivated, and can retain my mental focus better than I have in years. I'm more willing to and capable of interacting socially with people, despite being a severe introvert. I'm less of a pessimist and generally more pleasant to be around now than before I began treatment. I wish I'd been prescribed it when I was a teenager, as I believe my life could have been so different. I wouldn't stop taking Bupropion at this point even if they tried to tell me that I didn't need it anymore. I expect to take it for the rest of my life, and I'm fine with that."

Over the years I have changed dosages from 300 to 350, from 450 to 400, back down to 300, recently back to 450. There is a persistent sadness tightly woven through the fabric of my emotions and feelings. I function fairly well most of the time. Sometimes I feel stuck. I don't want to do anything except space out. I get stuck in my own head like I'm withdrawn into my own bubble. None the less. the Bupropion has enabled me to get up off my ass and most forward with life. Whenever I feel super stuck, I check in with my therapist and doctor. Sometimes we tweak the dosage. I also think some generic brands are poor quality. If you can get Wellbutrin, do it. The generic stuff can be wonky sometimes and I'm not trying to play Russian Roulette with my life. Coupled with therapy and a sharp progressive doctor, I can manage.

However, I'm keeping it all in perspective and motoring through the bad stuff. Smoked for 35 yrs, been wanting to quit 4-ever. Feeling good about myself.

I have only experienced two side effects. My blood pressure has risen a little bit, it used to be in the typical range.  And I am frequently nauseous. My stomach doesn't hurt. The nausea is mainly due to my neck being sensitive. If I have a necklace on or something around my neck, I will gag a lot. And sometimes I throw up. But taking ompeprazole has helped with the nausea.  Overall I am thankful for the medication.

It took me almost 2 weeks to get up the nerve to actually swallow this pill because I was so scared of the side effects. I am so glad that I did..It has helped me tremendously. The first couple of days were alittle rough adjusting to the side effects. But they were really no worse than what I was already experiencing..Jittery, nervous,agitated,emotional. If you are scared of taking this medication..please don't be! I was diagnosed with depression and was having severe panic attacks. I was given Bupropion HCL Xl and Xanax. I started out on 150mg tablets for the first week then started on the 300mg 1 x a day. What a difference this medicine has made. I am much more calmer now and my mood swings have greatly improved. So please don't be afraid to take this medicine because of the ""bad reviews""..I was the same way I would read the reviews and talk myself out of taking it. Atleast give it a chance...I know I'm sure glad I did!"

Tried Paxil briefly when I was younger and had intense side effects- sleep, teeth grinding, sex drive, felt more miserable. Few years later tried the generic of Wellbutrin XL. Started the first month at 150mg and didn't notice too much, then up to 300mg and felt a near immediate substantial improvement. Much more energy, less likely to let sad thoughts fester, much easier to get out of bed in the morning.

Lost my health insurance and fell off the medication for about 9 months and the last three got bad. Started back up a few weeks ago and after a couple days adjusting (side effects of a sort of mild vertigo, trembly hands) I've got the energy back and feel more capable. It's shown me the possibility of a tolerable, if not enjoyable life."

50$Condition: Other$2/3/2015 2:58:55 PM$Reviewer: Jlock, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$3$3$I have been taking Bupropion HCL XL 150mg for about a month and a half.  The beginning stages of it made me very sick.  I lost about 10 lbs in a week because I couldn't eat.  That subsided.  It has given me a little more energy but I have bad anxiety and after a month of taking it starting having panic attacks again so we added back Paxil which is what I was taking.  That has helped but the only problem now is that the Bupropion has caused me to have heart palpitations all day every day.  I kept waiting thinking they would go away but that didn't work so I just started this morning on Bupropion HCL SR 100mg and still take the 20mg Paxil in the evening.  I really want to stay on the Bupropion to maybe balance out the weight gain caused by Paxil, to have some energy, and it has brought back my sex drive which was in the negative for a long time.  If the heart palpitations don't stop I will have to go off of it though and I guess stick with Paxil.  I can't go through trying a new drug again.  The side effects are just too much.......

I'm 61. I've been diagnosed with depression bordering on major depression. I've gone thru 4 knee surgeries and now I've had a pacemaker installed. All this happened within the last 18 months. I went from a wheelchair to walking with my cane during that time. I feel my body is breaking down. My exercise routine has been hindered. I can't do the things I could've done before. I have to accept that I'm getting old! All of these factors contributed to taking Bupropion. I have to tell my mental health provider on the next session; that I've increased my dosage. This stems from the latest problems that have transpired. I increased the dosage from 300mg to 400mg. I feel so much better. I see her every 120 days. She knows everything about me. Initially asking many questions ranging from my social life to my sex life. That's to determine what dosage I needed. The only problem; I can't get an erection. Bupropion has the least sexual side effect on that problem. I'll have to live with it. But it really upsets me. I feel that my male ego has been devastated. But life goes on. We review how things are going. She keeps my medical file up to date. We come to an agreement what dosage I need after discussing what's been going on in my life. She's really a great nurse practitioner. Someone to talk and listen to. I enjoy going to see her. I look forward to all of my future sessions with her.

I took it 5 years and have been off it 3 years, taken off this poison by a nonAmerican doctor who doesn't buy into the ""give-a-pill"" theory of medicine. Wellbutrin has changed my brain permanently. I was never angry before. Now I live every day very angry. My life is hell filled with anger. This medication is poison. Please, don't do this to your life and your brain. Run very far. I would give anything not to have taken this poison. I'm very sure my Medicare paid for the mags on my first doctor's Porsche. Eat right and exercise. Do not surrender to the ""medicines"" Rx companies give you. They don't care what it does to your brain. They only care about their profits. PLEASE, PLEASE take this seriously.

At first, I felt some occasional mild dizziness but that was only temporary and it was nothing serious.

No general anxiety, don't care to smoke, can focus better than ever. Without, I am situationally depressed with daily anxiety which causes me to smoke constantly. I wouldn't have an attention span to write this review. I don't feel as if I am on medication with this drug. NOW that's how you know its a good fit. If I forget to take it I can usually tell that I did within 24 hrs. Once I felt normal there was no turning back. Originally given this for postpartum depression when I started noticing all of my other tedious issues subside. I can honestly say that I never want to go back to feeling ""trapped inside crazy"" and that's exactly how postpartum felt. I would recommend this to anyone with similar issues. Especially adult ADHD. It takes about a month to take full effect and about a week of withdrawls to come off it. I can honestly say that I feel like a complete idiot with out it. The best time to take it varies from person to person. They say take in the morning but it makes me very tired. I take it before bed and about six hours on the dot I wake up every morning feeling refreshed and ready. I've heard that most take it in the morning just fine but I'm usually the exception with everything I take. NOTE: XL & SR are two different breeds. The SR made me feel like I was on speed. If you are the dead sleeping depressed than that should be just what you need."

I was on it 3 years ago. But stopped. Now, my nurse practitioner asked many questions stemming from my sexual activity, diet, contact with friends and family, church and other things. She compiled a history about me. She's a fantastic person. She decided my starting dosage would be two 100mg tablets; one when I wake up and the other at noon. We will discuss the dosage after two months. At that time she might increase my dosage. For me it is an appetite suppressant. I have some sexual side effects; I take Trazedone to maintain my erection. And it helps me go to sleep. You really need to work together to overcome depression. Overall Bupropion HCL works for me.

The only thing that helped me last night was taking 50 mg of the Pristiq again. I am stopping this generic immediately.  I would be willing to try the brand name Wellbutrin XL as I have read many reviews stating that the generic and brand name versions are very, very different.  I would be willing to bet that I would not have had this negative experience if my doctor had prescribed the the brand name version instead of the generic.  Now, onto Fetzima tomorrow.

We literally LIVED at the hospital for 6 months.  I couldn't see straight, through the anxiety and depression.  I thought I would never laugh, smile, sing, dance, or live again.  On Wellbutrin, which I'm taking in 3 sustained release tablets a day (300 mg), I can laugh, smile, sing, dance and live again.  I also take Sertraline (another antidepressant), but it wasn't enough.  Wellbutrin was added after months of Sertraline didn't help completely and made me VERY sleepy.  Wellbutrin helped a little with energy and significantly with mood.  I suppose if I got enough sleep, Wellbutrin could really help with my energy levels, but I'm happy enough being able to get up in the morning and stay awake at work (most days).  Seriously, on Wellbutrin I can laugh again.

It ended up being the only antidepressant I could take.  It helped with my energy level although I never really felt the same after the major depressive episode which put me on antidepressants in the first place.  It was very easy to come off of, no side effects but I felt a bit of a decrease in energy with an increased feeling of apathy, lack of interest, little enthusiasm.  After a couple of months, I started to gain weight for no apparent reason. I wasn't eating more; after another month or so the weight started increasing at a faster rate. Because of some other symptoms, I believe I need glandular support, mainly thyroid, so am taking supplements and natural remedies. I have begun to lose a little weight and the muscle heaviness I was feeling is subsiding. Of course I'm still seeing my counselor; working on relationships, self-esteem and lots of other stuff. If you're gaining weight after Bupropion and wonder if that is the reason, it very well could be. What's working for me is Iodine,Selenium,L-Tyrosine. I've always been a regular exerciser (running) but that wasn't keeping my weight under control like it always has, and it was becoming more difficult because of the sluggishness I was feeling, then the extra weight to carry around.

After two weeks on the higher dosage, the metalic taste is still there but not as bad.  I'm not waking up at night, and the other positive effects - like not freaking out about stuff so quickly/often have made me want to stick with it a little longer to see if the bad effects go away.

This was before it was prescribed for people who wanted to quit smoking.  I mentioned that to my doctor and he discounted it.  Whatever.  Bupropion worked very well for me with my chronic depression for a few years mostly by helping me focus and get out of bed in the morning.  I switched to Paxil when the side effects of clenching my jaws and muscle tremors outweighed the benefits.  Paxil was awful -- I picked my skin, drank too much alcohol, had no impulse control, couldn't cry, gained weight.  Tried Zoloft next -- suffered massive, gross skin sores; toe, foot and leg cramps; urinary incontinence.  Then tried Cymbalta which seemed like it worked, but was too expensive, so I went back to bupropion.  It's worked really well for a few months.  My skin is good again and my emotional responses are normal.  I can get up and go in the morning, even though I'm very wakeful during the night.  I lost my Paxil weight.  However, I'm bummed because I'm starting the jaw clenching again and feel that slide toward needing another change.  Ack!  At least I'll be retired in a couple of weeks and only my daughters and dogs will have to join me for my next medication ride.  I'm hopeful it'll be a smooth transition.

90$Condition: Other$2/28/2014 9:41:49 AM$Reviewer: moodbegone, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month$5$5$5$I have been on this medication for about 3 weeks now, and I am taking it for anxiety and a mood disorder from a very stressful life I have had for the past 10 years. I have to say that it's been very effective at controlling my anxiety and making me feel good on a constant level. Before I had ups and downs all the time, as there are more negative things in my life than positive. This drug has allowed me to feel better than I have been for a long time. I noticed that a lot of you are on other drugs, you should consider that the drug may not be effective because of these other drugs. Talk to your doctor about that. I am not on other drugs. Also I noticed that more females on here seem to find it ineffective, while most males find it effective. Not sure why that is. I am not disregarding the negative effects it may have caused for other people, just saying it has helped me. I am also not a fan of taking drugs, so I do not plan on being on it for a long time period of time. 
91$Condition: Depression$2/27/2014 6:29:20 PM$Reviewer: greengirl12, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$2$2$Buproprion HCL SR 150mg. I wanted to try Adderall for focus on school and general duties; along with depression, but doctor gave me this. Overall, this worked for me. I got out of bed, got done what NEEDED to, and lost weight fast,which motivated me more. After 1 week, I decided to get off it because of my circumstances...new job, school-had to perform as all eyes were on me, and most certainly felt that. The bad...I was overly self-conscious, my heart raced to where I felt tired but felt I had to do something because I couldn't sleep. My memory sucked...I felt spacey. Now, if I weren't in the new job with all this pressure, I would have stuck with it to see if SE went away. My question to ANYONE out there (please answer!!) is do these SE go away? Thinking to ask for half the dose and up it as needed. In the meantime, has anyone divided the tablet or is that not recommended with Extended release? Many thanks for any info. I am not on any other drugs by the way. Oh yes, another great thing...I am a heavy drinker which I found hard to stop but this helps and that is a wonderful thing...fewer cravings.

So far I am not impressed with it. I am currently also taking 150mg of Effexor Extended Release.  Was on 225mg Effexor until 2wks ago when doctor started me on Bupropion.  The Bupropion the doctor has me on is the immediate release one b/c she wants to see if its working since Im also taking the Effexor.  After I take the Bupropion I can feel the effects for about an hour, but after that nothing.  It makes me tired & sleepy.  Im thinking maybe my dose needs to be raised and I need to be put on the extended release tab instead.  I go back to the doctor in a week so I will voice my concerns then. 
98$Condition: Depression$1/23/2014 2:10:58 AM$Reviewer: berlinATX, 35-44 Female  (Patient) $3$1$5$"I had taken Wellbutrin for depression with successful results approx 10 years ago and had very favorable results: I had energy to get through the day, felt all-around better. But eventually it just stopped working (and I had reached the maximum dosage/day)I found the more I spoke to others who were taking the med (or had taken) said they had the same experience. 
Now I've been taking Prozac for the same reason and it works shockingly well but I have 0 libido...no more like -25 libido and have no highs or lows. Granted I'm not crying and it's helped my fibro-myalgia, improved my sleep and cut down on sweating but I'm a creative person and have lost all creative emotion. Enter Wellbutrin again. First day I've got pupils so dilated I can hardly function, massive anxiety, can't sleep, can't eat, nausea, everything smells strong and sickens me. I felt generally serotonin sick. I think if I had a benzo script I could muddle through but I've yet to have any psychiatrist give me one in over 5 years since Xanax got ""trendy"". Needless to say, I'm back at Prozac until I can even tell my doctor what happened. 
My advice is follow your gut. If you feel really horrible, it's probably not worth forcing it. I've done that with other meds like Paxil and wound up in the ER with mania and not a single doctor in the whole place intersted in or able to help...and that's scary."

The more he asked me questions, the more I finally realized that I was depressed and had been for a couple of years. I was having such negative dark thoughts and the doctor prescribed this to me with a high dosage immediately.  It took a few weeks but I am so glad I got help.  I started to feel better, had more energy where before I could barely make it through the day. I lost weight and started feeling more positive.  I experienced an increase in libido and a slightly decreased appetite.  I started exercising and although I've suffered some additional setbacks, I have learned how to deal with them and keep moving forward.  I have forgotten to take my pills for 2-3 days at a time and I have began to feel ""icky"" again.  I am a work in progress and I hope that one day I will be able to live pill free by exercising regularly and eating a clean diet...I am working towards that but for now I am very happy with this medicine.  As for side effects, I am lactose intolerant and have IBS so any nausea or other discomfort have been indistinguishable.  I have occasionally experienced dizziness and slight headaches but other than that, I have not significant side effects.  "

The first week felt euphoric. My brain felt like it was growing, or at least, I was accessing parts of it that I hadn't in a L O N G time. The first 2 months I had: lots of headaches, loss of appetite, and increased heart rates at times. It was similar to having too much coffee; I was jittery. After 2 months that all faded away. Now, 6 months in, I can see that during my menstral cycle, my symptoms have increased. More cramping and bloating. I didn't have those symptoms before, but now I notice that they are regular symptoms for me. Might be the meds, might be my body developing. I had occasionally smoked cigarettes - like 1-2 times a month. I am absolutely, positively NOT IN THE MOOD for a cigarette - ever. It is incredibly unappealing to me now, even as occasionally as I had done it.

The first month was full of each side effect they listed. Some of those side effects were from quitting smoking I'm sure.  The others, like dry mouth, being unable to sleep at all, racing heartbeat, and itching made me want to quit.  I'm glad I didn't because now I have a lot of energy, smoke 0-4 cigs a day (from a pack a day), and have been able to successfully quit a job and start a new much better one.  I don't think I would've been able to quit the job at all without this med.  It's mellowed out my thinking a lot. My boyfriend agrees.  I didn't see it as much of a big deal.  I'm happy with it.

After trying to take this for 2 weeks, I gave up & went back to what made me, temporally, happy. Yes, while taking this drug I did not have a real urge to smoke, but my mood, attitude, and thoughts were terrible. I was very aggravated with life, every big and small things pissed me off to the extreme. I felt like a robot most of the time. I would go to work/school, come home after it wore off, and hadn't really remember that I was an active person in society. My thought process was very clear, like never before. But being that I was able to think about my situation, that made me that more angry. It gave me a terrible taste in my mouth that I could not get rid of, & dry mouth. I've always had trouble sleeping, so I was given something more to help with that. I do recall smoking once, maybe twice while on this and it make me regurgitate. So I wouldn't recommend ""experimenting"" with this drug and maryGreen if you're 420 friendly."

I went and saw a psychiatrist instead of my primary care physician who knows nothing about mental health. The psychiatrist first started me on 150mg of Bupropion and advised me to continue to take the Cymbalta as well. The first week I could feel a major difference. I had a hard time sleeping at night but that went away after a week. But my feelings and moods were changing and I felt so much happier. Within the first month of taking 150mg, my appetite decreased, my energy INcreased, my moods became much more pleasant...and I was becoming a more positive person. But I was still feeling a few signs still of my Depression. My bed is my ""safe haven"" and where I go when I am depressed, I nap. I encountered about a handful of naps in that one month. I was still feeling like a worry-wart and had irritation issues. So when I saw the psychiatrist again after those 4 wks, he increased my dosage to the 300XL while still taking 120mg of Cymbalta. This is now my 2nd week taking this medicine with the increased dosage... and I feel absolutely amazing. I feel as though I have woken up from a deep sleep. I have so much energy. I can exercise because I have motivation. I am so much more pleasant with people at work and just in general. I can think rationally and be positive. I feel absolute love for myself. I no longer feel like a worthless, ugly, ashamed individual who could never leave the house. I feel A L I V E. I could literally hug my psychiatrist for listening to me and not over-medicating me. This medicine has helped me so much, you have to give it the full 4wks to feel the effects but wow. It has changed my entire life. "

I expect I will be able to get off of it completely in a year; but also expect to need to go on it again.

I have seen other sites where individuals described a ""honeymoon"" period when starting the Wellbutrin ( Bupropion ), then a difficult period with the side effects until the 6th week sometimes up to 12 weeks and then the drug began to work very well. That is my story as well. It was difficult and very scarey until then but worth the trip for me as I feel better now than I have in years."

I hated having to take this medication with food because it made me feel nauseous; other than that, I never had experienced other side effects.  I was instructed to take 300 mg a day when my doctor thought 150 mg was too small of a dose.  

I never felt a difference on either dosages; I was still very depressed and still had several crying episodes.  The feeling of sadness and emptiness still lingered.  I hoped it would help with my anxiety as well, but it didn't help with that either.  I'm not surprised by the ineffectiveness of this drug because I have never taken an antidepressant that has changed my mood and kept my anxiety at ease.  I wasted my money on this drug.  I no longer take any antidepressants or see a psychologist because it's a waste of my time and money.  "

I can say that within 2 weeks or so I wasn't so despondent and bleak.   I actually can say that I became euphoric and felt there was more to life than justing working, eating and sleeping.  I began to notice that I became very hyper and almost manic.  I started to snap at my family and employees (I'm told more than usual), and develpoed palpitations, hypertension, ringing in the ears, dry mouth, frequent need to urinate, horrible neck, and upper back pain, and difficulty falling asleep (which is already a know cause for depression...imagine that!  I was cut fromm 300 to 150mg and noticed 50% less pain.  Two days ago I quit cold turkey (per my Dr), and I HAVE NO NECK PAIN ANYMORE!  What is also odd is that I still have a feeling of euphoria, but less anxiety.  Maybe I never needed the drug, it just could have been a rocky time in my life.  There is so much evidence regarding the placebo effect.  I hope that this is the case.  If my depression returns, I will believe that it was truly the wellbutrin than helped.  I am going to attempt Buspar for my anxiety.  I'll comment in a few months if anyone is interested.

I actually was having bad anxiety before i started it and have been on it a few wks and anxiety decreased some. But i imagine it will affect different people differently. Took my stomach a long time to adjust to new meds even taking with food but its improved after about 2 wks now. Sleeping has still been trouble to stabilize but i haven't been taking 2nd dose at consistent same time trying to figure out what works best. Not needing as much sleep compared to before i started taking it. And the important thing if it has improved my depression-I have only been on it for about 2 or 3 wks so know it won't be fully working yet. Depression improved slightly but hard to tell if it has to do with meds or other factors of things going on in life at this time. Still hoping for the best...

I wanted to get away from the SSRI/SNRI meds so I suggested Wellbutrin to my doctor as an alternative. He had some reservations but started me on the 75mg immediate release Bupropion. One tablet for two days. No problems so the dose was increased to two tablets per day for the next ten days. At this point I was feeling a bit ""wired"" with some muscle twitches and difficulty sleeping. I believe these are typical with this medication. Also had a slight headache. Not real bad but always there. At this point I am wondering if this is the right medication for me. Feeling ""different"" but not really getting the relief that I wanted. I went to three tablets per day for about three weeks. Still having some issues at this point but I was seeing some benefits. Went to four tablets for the next ten days with much improvement.
   My most recent prescription was for Bupropion HCL 100mg taken three times a day. After about six weeks into this I feel much improved and confident that this medication will work well for me. Do not discount the effectiveness of this medication too quickly as there are some rough spots to get past before any benefit is seen.
   I did use low dose Klonopin to take the ""edge"" off the Bupropion. I did not need more than 1mg per day at the most and I am at a point where I believe I can stop it completely. The sleep issues have been resolved nicely with a 10mg dose of Doxepin at bedtime.
   Each individual is different as to the medications that work best. This is working for me.

My doc said to take 150mg each of the first four days, then 300mg per day. I didn't notice much of anything at all the first there days, but on the fourth day, I woke up at 4:00, feeling cranked up, then I thought I'd go ahead and take the fourth day's dose. That last dose was horrible. It felt like I had drunk a couple of posts of black coffee after missing sleep for about a week.

I troopered on and increased my dose to 300mgs, thinking I was just going through an acclimation period. Wrong! I had all the irritable side effects, the tinnitus, the insomnia. It was very similar to speed except without the horrible crash during the wearoff.

Finally, I called my doc and told her it was no good. She said I could cut the pills in half but that they would no longer be SR since the innards would be exposed. On the 75mg twice a day dose, sometimes I thought I was doing all right. But then the next day would be awful again, especially the insomnia. I cut the pills again, down to 37.5 mg twice a day, and I feel almost nothing except tinnitus and sometimes insomnia, but not as bad. There's no good side on this low dose, however. One good thing, unlike SSRIs, there's no ejaculatory disfunction on this drug. It even makes you sort of horny."
194$Condition: Depression$4/14/2011 2:54:00 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I started burpropion (generic version of Wellbutrin) almost a year ago after a tragic suicide left me with anxiety, depression, and PTSD. I was first prescribed Celexa which was great, but I had gained weight. So a few months later, my doc prescribed me Bupropion in addition. I was on 10mg/once a day Celexa and then prescribed 150mg/twice a day Bupropion. I had horrible side effects from the Bupropion- I felt drunk, sea sick, nervous, loss of appetite, couldn't sleep, woke up often in the night etc.  The 150mg/twice a day proved to be too much, and actually caused more anxiety than I started with. Sometimes going for a higher dose isn't the right answer. I went down to once a day dose of 150mg and it was magic! Together with celexa, I have gotten a hold of my depression/anxiety/OCD/PTSD. And, I have lost the 10 lbs I gained when first starting Celexa- yipee! If considering, or becoming discouraged with this drug- try out lower doses! Also- I'd suggest giving any SSRI medication at least 2 months to let the side effects wear off. I have absolutely no side effects now, and happy as can be!

I could definitely see this helping anyone for weight loss since I didn't want to eat anything even when I was hungry. But for anxiety, it made mine much worse. I also felt completely in my head and unable to control myself. I was having a difficult time controlling what came out of my mouth, which is scary in the office...i had to stop taking it.

My advice to anyone taking it is please wait a full month before you decide it isn't working (extenuating circumstances aside like if your suffering severe side effects then by all means consult your doctor) but I have felt better and better everyday since taking it. This has been my wonder drug and has given me my life back. I can concentrate better and have gotten my motivation back to pursue my personal goals in life. I hope everyone has the same results as I did. If you haven't don't give up there is something out there that can help you, and it is so worth it in the end.

Can say it definetly helps with the smoking. For the depression it is hard to tell. it gives me more energy but i am irratable and angry for no reason alot of the time and small things will just set me off now. Also have had bad ringing in ears periodiocally and can't stop clenching my jaw. finally realized what was making me do it.Bad dreams at night but might not be from this. Also seem more anxious especially in public. Foods taste different especially things i used to enjoy i don't like anymore.

I haven't really noticed any big differences except this week would've been my BIG mood swing time of the month and I didn't have any. It is definitely cutting down my appetite which is great, as a result of my depression I was dwelling on situations and would eat or drink late at night and basically binge on snacks. I will take my 30 days dose and if I notice any bad side effects (like hair loss, ringing in ears as I have read on here) I will request to be changed to wellbutrin which who knows if my insurance will cover. I am going to Mexico in 2 weeks and they sell the brand name Wellbutrin for $100 a bottle with no prescription needed, I guess I will see if my insurance will cover it first. I've taken it in the past and my sex drive multiplied by 10 which was great as my depression had diminished my sex drive and general interest in anything. So far Buproprion hasn't changed sex drive but it's only been a week."

I was put on it for my anxiety issues which literally kept me up every single night.  I can now sleep through the night which I can not be more thankful for!  However, the last couple of months I notice myself becoming more and more aggitated and going back to how I was in that sense.  I really do not like the idea of being on a pill and I even faught it for some time, but it got to the point where I wasn't living my life at all.  This pill has helped me regain some control over my anxiety, but I can tell it is slowly wearing off if this makes sense to anyone.

I have a little lift (no jitters), sleep fully and peacefully through the night without dreams, dry mouth is gone (I make sure to drink plenty of water now)I have stable energy through the day, I am not hungry or anxious about food (lost 9 lbs with South Beach diet in two weeks)- unfortunately, my libido - no change so far:(  However, I read it could take 6-7 weeks to fully take effect, so here is hoping!!)
I still get emotional during appropriate times (sad movies)- so I am definitely not a Zombie!
Once the libido increases, definite 5 stars for both effectiveness and satisfaction."

My doctor initially put me on 150mg/1x a day, but then raised it to 150mg/2x a day.  Almost immediately, I experienced positive results.  It was working so well for me, that I jokingly called it my ""happy pills"".  Everything seemed to be going quite well, no side effects, no more panic attacks, etc.  Then, on December 13, 2010, out of the blue, I had a grand mal seizure.  I had never had a seizure in my life previously.  A month+ later, and major testing having been done, from CT scans, to MRIS, EEGs, EKGs, carotid artery sonogram, sonogram of my heart, stress test EKG and an event monitor...not to mention numerous trips to a cardiologist and neurologist...it was finally determined that the seizure was caused by the bupropion.  Apparently, this drug can lower the seizure threshold in people...and at one point was removed from the market due to the fact that it was being administered at higher levels (than what are currently recommended), and it was causing a high incidence of seizures in people.  I think far too many people are unaware of that fact.  Don't misunderstand though...if I could take it again, and know I wouldn't have a seizure, I would do so in a heartbeat, it worked that well for me.  Just be aware that it can cause seizure issues...but if you can take it with no side effects, IME, it worked extremely well."

I just feel better. I am in less pain and no longer dwell on things for long periods of time. There was some feelings of agitation for a couple hours after taking a dose at first, but this passed after about two weeks. I sometimes have a light ringing in my ears, and I seem to get overly excited from time to time (a new feeling), a small price to pay for feeling better. Recommend starting with a very small dose and SLOWLY building up, that's what I did.

I think it was probably a panic attack at the idea of quitting smoking in the first place. The second week I felt fine, started cutting down rather effortlessly. This is my third week and am happy to say I have not had a smoke in 3 days. I suddenly want to get rid of all my ashtrays, throw away my lighters. My only caution...DO NOT DRINK ALCHOHOL WHILE TAKING THIS DRUG. It will mess you up and make you feel totally toxic in a very bad way for up to 48 hours after only having 2 drinks. Needless to say, once that occured, I have not had a drink in 2 weeks either. I am assuming that a good thing for me. All-in-all, I feel great now.

After a week of this medication, my doc wanted me to up the dosage to 2 pills daily. During my very first day of taking this medication I had adverse reactions.  My heart beat increased and I felt somewhat anxious.  Several days later I began taking the 2 pills per day as prescribed.  I noticed my neck began itching and had red blotchy spots appeared. Not only that but I became quite irritated and my husband said I was ""a bear"" while on this stuff. One of the most unpleasant effects was that I began ""clenching"" my teeth together and noticed an awareness in my teeth I'd never experienced before. This alarmed me so I called my dr's office. The nurse suggested I go back down to one pill again and come back in and see the doctor.  I have since been taking Sertraline (generic of Zoloft) with less adverse effects.  I have been on it now for almost 3 weeks and it's already much better than the Wellbutrin SR ever was.  The only good thing about this med is that it didn't have any bad sexual side effects...if anything it increased sexual desire.  But the bad far outweighed the good on this one."

I guess my beginning was uneventful, because I don't recall any adverse reactions. In retrospect, I did have vivid bad dreams and night sweats that I attributed to menopause. At my last check up my doctor suggested that maybe I didn't need this drug anymore. We tapered from 100 mg. a day to 100 every other day, t0 100 every third day.  I have not been on any for about two weeks.  Starting on the day I reduced I have had gastrointestinal symptoms I never expected-- slight nausea, severe diarhea, burning in the top left of my abdomen, extreme thirst, tiredness, a bit of a headache.  I don't really think there have been psychological withdrawal symtoms, except that I find myself thinking that what I really am feeling gastrointestinally are signs of some horrible fatal illness (anxiety?).

I have been on several medications for depression and I have found that in my case it wasn't so much the drug as it was the dosage and combination of drugs.  Granted I have been diagnoses with major depression, as well as cancer, so the multi drug treatment isn't always for everyone.

Before Bupropion I was glued to my couch feeling bad for myself. I ramped up to 150mg before I really got motivated because I was also on Citalopram. With the motivation came high anxiety and clenching of my teeth which gave me headaches. I felt like I was on drugs all the time.

Finally, we reduced the Citalopram to 5mg, reduced Bupropion SL to 100mg and added a little (2.5mg)of Zyprexa.  Now I'm human again and I don't feel like I'm on drugs.

Warnings: Zyprexa has caused me to gain weight but worth not feeling like I'm on drugs. One last thing.  I've tried several drugs and none got rid of the ringing in my ears.  I just humm to it instead."

Benifits- I have a lot more energy, Sleep so good on this stuff. I used to have bouts of getting maybe 9 hours of sleep in a 7 day peroid. Now I sleep 9 hours every day. So of course that has helped the, being a meany from lack of sleep syndrom. And of course the reduction of smoking. Don't know if I will ever totaly be able to give them up. Been smoking for 39 years. But for now am happy with how much I have cut down. Would highly recomend this drug for anyone who wants to quit or cut down. But I also haven't exsperienced a lot of the side effects others have.  So I guess, to each his own and good luck.

Release is not consistent, complaints were made to FDA, FDA followed up and determined that it was 50% effective and therefore equivalent.  NOT TRUE !  I take the generic made by Anchen (?) and have had no issues.  It even looks like the Wellbutrin brand.  Walgreen's carries TEVA in my area (because it's the cheapest) ... my grocery store, Schnucks, carries the Anchen generic.  Good Luck !!!

The next 2 weeks my husband told me that my mood swings were worse then ever and when I thought back to conversations I have had with clients or classmates, my husband was right, I did have a very negative attitude. I didn't quit smoking because I found my self smoking twice as much and the day I did try to quit I became severly deppressed and had suicidal thoughts(I have never had thoughts like this before) So I quit the medication and started to smoke again.

My health care provider prescribed it in addition to fluoxetine, which helped with my symptoms but made me feel drowsy and lethargic. On the bupropion (150mg SR in the morning) I couldn't sleep, I was jumpy, my brain felt like I was full of electrical zaps. I felt less inhibited, but this was actually a bad thing -- I didn't trust myself to know what was and wasn't appropriate to say or do. It was kind of terrifying, actually. I felt like I just wanted my self back. I can tell I would have lost weight quickly if I had stayed on it for any length of time. I was way overstimulated by it. Wished it had worked out, but it most definitely wasn't for me. Right now I'm on a very low dose of fluoxetine (10mg) to minimize side effects. Hoping to get off of it completely, but at least it helps when I need it without messing me up that much.

Initially, and still (after 2 months), I noticed that while I can reach a physical climax and ejaculate without any problem (unlike with Prozac where this had become difficult), the ""rush"" felt in the brain is missing -- no toe-curling reaction that leads to the afterglow feeling. More of a ""that's it?"", kissing your sister kind of feeling.

Recently, I have noticed a complete loss of libido - no interest in sexual stimuli that is usually a turn-on. I don't know if this is bupropion-related or not; I don't see sexual side effects listed at this website. In fact the reason I switched from prozac to bupropion was to reduce sexual dysfunction, which it has to some extent.

I wonder if anyone else has experienced these symptoms?"

I was overly angry at a friend of mine for something minor and the anger and aggitation wouldn't go away and carried over to other things like my pen running out of ink.  My eyes dilated and I couldn't hold still and I had tremors all over. Seeing as I'm not manic to begin with I'm never taking the generic Bupropion again.  Doc switched me to Wellbutrin XL (brand name) and we'll see how that works.  I'll review that on Wellbutrin's profile though.

On the fourth day I noticed a decrease in appetite and a bit of jitteriness.  I thought I might lose some weight!  That night I had a total meltdown.  While lying in bed trying to fall alseep, for no apparent reason I had the worst anxiety attack I have ever had.  I had the most horrifying and disturbing thoughts - things I am not capable of doing to those I love.  My husband sat up with me until I was finally able to sleep.  I stopped taking the drug immediately and felt better in a day or two.  It was extremely scary - felt like a ""bad trip"" I had once as a teen.  I won't take another anti depressant after that.  I don't know how drugs like this help people. "

314$Condition: Depression$1/1/2009 10:41:44 PM$Reviewer: SomethingsGottaGive, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$3$5$Well when takin alone, this stuff really works.  I tried every other drug before this one, and I must say this was the easiest for me to adapt to in regards to side effects.  However I was also givin Lorazepam with it which I ended up abusing and then even using alcohol and marijuana on top of it.  My advice would be to just take the bupropron sr alone with nothing else.  Alcohol and marijuana do not mix well with this.  I was feeling great after two weeks of taking this med but then started smoking pot again, and within 2 days I was back to my depressed self.  I stopped the lorazepam because I felt tired all the time and bupropion is supposed to make me wired, not tired.  So in the end, I realized to get better, I would have to ditch all my bad habits, and subtitute them with this drug, bupropion.  If you smoke pot or drink or do any other kinda narcotics, I would suggest not doing them at all if you truly want to get the full benefit of this medication.

I used a generic non timed release and found I actually experienced withdrawal symptoms between doses.

Even though I only used drug for a few weeks I have never had an urge for another cigarette and that was about 5 years ago.

When the SR and XL came out, I was switched to those and continued to do well. Now that BCBS won't pay except for generic, I went on Budeprion and had to double the dosage to get the same effectiveness. I never had panic attacks before but they started and I thought they were due to birth control pills I began taking to deal with bleeding problems. THEN, I did mail order and they gave me BUPROPION (not Budeprion) - it went rapidly downhill from there to the point where thoughts of harming myself occurred for the 1st time in years. Realized they gave me even the wrong generic - note the syllables - had to call my doc, the insurance, cuz it would've been $125. Still having problems with insurance cuz of mail order - never gonna do that again! I still have problems with any generic and wish the brand name was affordable. They shouldn't play with people's lives - generics are not as effective! "

My doctor told me to quit within a week of taking it, but I read in multiple sources that you could quit after taking it for up to two weeks.  I quit after taking it for two weeks, and up to that point I had no problem cutting back from 1 pack a day to the day before I quit, only 2 cigarettes the whole day.  Today makes 2 weeks that I haven't smoked a cigarette, and I don't really miss anything, have any cravings or withdrawal symptoms, and found that I don't even really need the nicotine lozenges I bought.  Additionally, I have experienced an overall feeling of better health, and I think that I am benefitting from the drug in other ways.  I am considering asking to be kept on this medication, the results are really great.  I haven't noticed a single side effect that I can directly contribute to the drug.  I have been and will continue to recommend it to anyone who wants to quit smoking...IT WORKS!!!

334$Condition: Stop Smoking$7/8/2008 4:40:49 PM$Reviewer:  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year$5$5$5$I started on this medication 6 months ago to quit smoking. I felt such an improvement in my mood and disposition that I asked my doctor to let me keep taking it even though I have already quit smoking. I think the reason why it was so hard for me to stay off smoking was because I was self-medicating my depression symptoms with nicotine. I don't miss it a bit now. The first day I took this medication I had vivid dreams that were somewhat sexual. I have had an increase in sexual desire since starting it but I don't know if it's the medication or the relief of depression that is the cause. I get an occasional headache that lasts for a few seconds and goes away. These are rare about 4 or 5 times a week. It does make my mouth dry and I relieve that by chewing sugarless gum or eating sugarless lifesavers. I have had no change in my weight or eating habits, I am not trying to gain or lose weight. I have had a huge increase in my energy and ability to organize my time. My depression was causing me to be lethargic and disinterested and I did not realize it. Occasionally I have trouble sleeping on this medication but I do not feel tired during the day. I have not had any problem with drinking alcohol while taking it. Overall I give it 5 stars and would recommend it for mild depression.

I have been on the drug for 2 years and during that time span, it's probably happened 10 times. The morning after I have had a drink or two, I will wake up in bed with the room spinning violently, feeling like I have been slammed onto the floor, and I have to get up and stumble dizzily to the bathroom in order to get sick. My doctor said that you can still drink while taking this medication, but that it will increase the effects of alcohol- so you feel drunker on less booze. However, the vertigo has increased ever since I increased my dosage to recover from S.A.D. Now, I've woken up with vertigo twice in the past week. I think I need to not drink any alcohol for a couple weeks to see if it gets better.

However, I am glad that I started taking it, because Bupropion has been very helpful in treating my depression and has allowed me to do better at work, as well as given me the energy to pursue the things I know I want out of life."

I was able to wean myself off the sleeping aid after two months and have only had a few bouts of insomnia since.

It generally worked well for me, though I recommend starting on a low dose and gradually working your way up to help minimize the side effects. I found it to be much better than the SSRI's as I tend to be sensitive to the sexual side effects and prone to weight gain. I generally felt good on wellbutrin and it didn't sedate me like so many others. The problem I noticed was that I was suddenly having trouble with receding gums. My hormones are changing and I told myself it must be related to that. However, I remembered that I started to have difficulty the first time I was on it, but then no further problems after I had gotten off of it. But once I was back on it, my dental exams had gone downhill drastically. Coincidence? It seemed unlikely that it would be related to this drug. Yes, it causes dry mouth, but receding gums? I haven't found anything about this in all of my research. Still, it seemed pretty drastic a change since I got back on it. I listened to my intuition and got off of it. I went from needing ""deep cleanings"" every couple of mos. to regular cleanings every six mos. and things have stabilized. Hmmmm...."

I have never been so miserable. I have horrible side effects. It is supposed to help my anxiety, not make it worse. I am constantly anxious and my heart feels like it is beating out of my chest. I am going to stop taking and start taking effexor again, so that I can feel like a better, normal person. I would rather have a few extra pounds and feel better than to feel anxious and sick 24/7.

Now after using it by it self ( I started it with smaller doses of the drug I had been useing ) for a week or so, the same feeling I had before is back, even I am not at the full dosage yet.

I rarely get headaches, and I'm generally in good health. I've had a headache for over a month, with the first 2-3 weeks very severe including vomiting, diarrhea, cold sweats, and pounding headaches triggered by anything that got my heart rate up, like turning over in bed when I awoke. My ears have been plugged/ringing the whole time as well. My body temp is 97*, and for the first time in my life, I've had serious suicidal thoughts.  I'm raising hell at my work. I have to take this info to my boss in the AM to explain my behavior. I'm a fool for trusting the five health care professionals I went to for help. I had faith in their knowledge and assumed they would do routine look ups of a med I'd been on for months. I was sitting on my couch having a panic attack for the first time in my life so I desperately went to WebMD. In sixty seconds I new more about my severe condition than three trips to the ER(Spinal Tap,CAT Scan, useless pain killers), my own doctor(different pain pill), and the help line (Go to the ER) could tell me. I just want to know, how do I get off this stuff? Dose changes amplify the symptoms, I know. I'm stopping the med. I hope this is the cause. I am a mad man and my brain hurts like physical damage, but at least I don't smoke.

I still struggle with those feelings, but Wellbutrin XL (or the generic now) has helped immensely.  I'm on a 300mg/day dosage which I take in the morning.  It has allowed me to get past the feelings of worthlessness and near-paralyzing sadness.  

The only problems I've had with Wellbutrin is a reduction in my sex drive, an infrequent side effect of this drug. Maybe I'm just lucky.  I also highly recommend not stopping usage of this quickly.  I stopped for a couple weeks then started up again, only to have my internal chemistry sent into a tailspin.  For almost three weeks after, I had to deal with severe anxiety, sadness, depression, almost to the point where I needed to visit the local emergency room.  My system has since re-balanced, but I highly recommend not following in my footsteps.  Continue using or talk to your doctor before cessation.  "

To this date so far 1/1/15, It cuts down on my smoking and used to smoke 15-20 cigs a day and now I only smoke 3.  I don't have that craving feeling to smoke! 

I weighed at 191 lbs when I started and now I am down to 185 and for me that is a very good feeling, may not seem a lot but I am happy.

I do not have any side effects.  No dry mouth cause I was on another kind of prescription meds and made me have dry mouth, plus I starved myself cause I was never hungry but it's only for a short period dose and with this dose and then I gained all the weight back, and with this you can keep taking it as long as you need it.

When you start this, it's so different how to take it per week. They start you out at week 1: one pill in morning, week 2: one pill in morning and one at night, week 3: two pills in morning and one at night, week 4: two pills in morning and two at night and you will always take this amount onward.

It is a bit expensive at $70.00 for 30 days but I do feel it's worth it, plus when I started this, I sent out online my first rx number and about 3 weeks later I got my free wireless scale and every morning I weigh myself and then they send me a txt message on my cellphone and it's positive words and little things to do if you feel like it.

Will keep everyone informed whoever reads this a update in 3 months.

Good Luck!"

Then, it was increased to 150mg x 2/day, which I took for a month and though I had more energy, I didn't think it helped my Adult ADD/ADHD much (not wanting a stimulant), so I abruptly stopped taking it at the end of the 2nd month (time for a refill). I already take Zoloft for depression, which works well. A side-effect of cessation is intense fatigue/tiredness. Yet, I seem to be MUCH more distracted now (having thought I was not much more focused). Yet, I believe it must have helped me some, so I am going back on it asap!
405$Condition: Depression$2/27/2016 1:16:53 PM$Reviewer: LarryV,  Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $4$5$5$I take Wellbutrin XL 300 mg and have been taking it for 6+ years. Prior to it, I tried every SSRI and newer drugs like Cymbalta. Wellbutrin is the only drug for depression that I could live with. ALL the others cause sexual problems, weight gain, sleepiness, fatique and still don't get rid of all the depression. One doctor added Zyprexa to the SSRIs I was taking and I put on 40 pounds! Getting off SSRIs are tough too. Electric shocks felt in my head and lights. Would never ever go back to them. Wellbutrin actually caused a boost in libido, weight loss and high energy. If I had it to do over again, Wellbutrin XL would be the starting med, not the SSRI classes. Think about it this way: If you're depressed now, how much more will you be when you lose interest in sex, gain weight, fall asleep at work, home, doctor's waiting room and have no energy to do anything? Those are the downsides of the SSRI class of meds. For me, they made my life worse. I am rarely depressed now and take nothing else for it but an occasional Xanax if in a highly stressful situation at work. I lost all the weight I gained, hike 5+ miles on weekends, kayak and have a normal sex life. Please give Wellbutrin a try and if it doesn't work after a month or so, then try the others.

I have taken this my entire life, with the exception of my early years up to fifth grade. I recently went through a stint where I had tried to go off it once I had learned it was primarily an anti-depressant, and I began having problematic panic attacks and would go through periods in which I could not stop crying. Since being back on this, I must say I am satisfied with it. I have been off Concerta for a year, and Bupropion has helped me to also keep my ADHD problems(impulsiveness, hyperactivity) in check. I know this whole review probably doesn't matter too much, but I wanted to give some insight for people with ADHD who are either starting or debating starting this medication. I see a lot of reviews from people who are taking this for depression, so it'd be good to see something from someone with ADHD. There are much fewer and less present side effects than Clonidine, so to me it's a good alternative.

Didn't make much of a difference, thought it was me. I went off that for a while and thought I just had to live with depression. 

Recently it started affecting me even more severely, so I looked into other medications. Welbutrin (bupropion) sounded like it was worth a try, since it affects dopamine receptors, not serotonin. I started it when I was 24, and what a difference it has made! It's been about a year now, and I can say that I actually feel normal. There is no long this yawning black hole over every day. There are still some days when I am sad, but it's relatively easy to get over it. The only bad thing about this drug was during the first 2 weeks of taking it: I had really bad insomnia, it was horrible. I had to take sleep aids every night. But that did eventually go away, now I sleep fine. 

Some people have said this drug is awful and no one should take it because it makes them super anxious/nervous/irritable, etc. Well that means it's probably the wrong drug for you. I would say, have an open mind, work with your doctor, and try different treatments until you find the one that works for you. This definitely worked for me, it has been a God send. "

It's better than Wellbutrin which is Buproprion hydroCHLORIDE. Smoother, less stimulation, fewer and less severe side effects. It's worth a try if buproprion seems to help but not just quite right for you.

424$Condition: Depression$8/14/2009 2:33:44 PM$Reviewer: marcie, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $2$2$5$"I've been on this medication for about 2 years, 300 mg daily.   There have been no unbearable side effects -- just a tendency toward constipation.

In the past, I've used others that were more effective, but had such bad side effects that I had to quit them. Overall, I think this takes the basic depression from about a constant 8 down to a constant 3 or 4.    There have been many episodes of being quite depressed while on it.  

Frankly, I'd rather take it than try other things.  I've used so many over the years, and I'm tired of experimenting.  "

426$Condition: Depression$4/28/2019 10:05:23 PM$Reviewer: Jo, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$5$"Background: 
I’ve experienced depression on and off since I was 14. In university, I was a physics major, which was challenging and engaging, but could also be soul-crushingly hard. Even getting slightly behind would leave me completely overwhelmed struggling to catch up. Multiple times I fell into a hole of deep depression, binging/bulimia. 

Despite all this, I got hired to do my dream job the summer before senior year. When I got back to school however, I started slipping back into depression. Everything in my life was good, so I couldn’t understand why I was still depressed. At this point I had tried every non-medication treatment under the sun: therapy, meditation, journaling, etc. There are so many things they say you should do when you’re depressed (get out of the house, exercise, challenge negative thoughts, engage your mind in a task, etc.), but for me it was almost impossible to do these things when my brain was telling me I couldn’t even get out of bed. I decided to see a psychiatrist. 

Experience on medication: 
I I got lucky that Wellbutrin was the first thing my clinician prescribed me — bc I genuinely felt a difference within the first day. Tasks no longer seem insurmountable, and I can easily challenge my negative thoughts or lack of motivation. 

I take 150mg and have actually been able to overcome lifelong insomnia with the help of a very consistent bedtime routine (dim lights, shower, make tea, do a couple Duolingo lessons, put meds on my bedside table, and watch an ASMR video). My alcohol tolerance is somewhat lower than before, but it’s not bothersome. The most interesting side effect is that while in most situations it keeps my emotions quite even-keeled, when I am watching a show, concert, movie, or other art form, I can become moved to tears by it — in a good way! Maybe this sounds silly, but I actually feel like I get to more fully experience what it means to be human now. Anyway, I can’t recommend Wellbutrin highly enough."

Its amazing. No withdrawals no headaches, I took two doses and by the second dose I couldn't stand the taste of cigs. This is a easy way to quite and even after I did the full round I guess the nicotine was out of my system totally cause I didn't want to go back at all! The only side effect my boyfriend noticed I did not was that he said I was a little more aggressive and short with him.

I started hearing buzzing in my ear and ringing. And then it began to feel like I was under water. I started feeling dizzy. I would spill drinks accidentally or miss steps walking down the stairs. I generally feel as if I am not on the ground. Needless to say I threw the prescription out. If you have sensitive ears, eyes, throat or family history of seizures of other history of imbalance, ear infection, even from swimming, do not take this medicine. I thought I was going to lose my hearing today the ringing and loud noises were unbearable. That said I don't know what caused these symptoms. I liked the evenness that I felt.

I have energy and ambition to do things I haven't had interest in for years. So far no side effects. Before taking it, when I would get up in the morning, it would take me hours to get going.  Now I feel good when I get up. If I feel this good after only 3 days,  I can imagine how I'll feel after a month or so. I took Celexa for years and actually think it made me worse. Needless to say it flat lined my libedo.  Sure hope the wellbutrin helps with that.

Once my pdoc paired it with an SSRI (Effexor XR), I have noticed a distinctive change in this medication's effects on me. It does cause a general increase in a person's Adrenaline levels, which explains the increased sweating and dry mouth. Most, if not all, side effects are temporary.  But beware going off this drug cold-turkey--it WILL cause electric shock-like sensations in your brain!

473$Condition: Depression$4/16/2013 10:50:55 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$3$5$I've been on Bupropion SR 100 mg 2x a day for about 4 1/2 weeks and so far I'm not sure it's working for me. I took it a few years ago in conjunction with therapy and it worked wonders- motivated, happy,less stressed. I also don't really remember any side effects. Since I've started taking it again (for depression/ADD/SAD)I haven't been feeling too much of a difference, in fact I have felt more easily moved to tears, moodier, still stressed, and even less social. I'm not sure if it's because I'm not currently in therapy, if it's interacting with my birth control, or if I just need to wait a few more weeks. Also side effects- first few weeks I would get very anxious and my hands would shake very badly which affected my job (dog grooming)that has since subsided and isn't as much of an issue. Loss of appetite, which isn't horrible but it gives me a weird feeling in my stomach, not nausea, almost feels like hunger but eating doesn't help. This has also gotten a bit better as time goes by. I'm hoping that if I just wait it out it will sort itself out, I don't see how it could have worked so well for me before and not now... Will update in a few weeks

477$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$3/22/2013 6:55:32 PM$Reviewer: blessedtobehere, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years$5$5$5$I have returned to mental health, after a deep and dark depression that led to suicidal intent.  Tried Prozac (which made me a wee bit manic), Celexa (which made me sluggish and disconnected) and finally, Wellbutrin SR which has been a godsend.  I really feel like myself and am delighted that all negative thoughts, suicidal and otherwise (i.e., self-doubts) are essentially gone.  I continue to work with an excellent therapist and, after the better part of two years, I am thinking that I may be well enough to begin weaning off the every other week sessions. Pretty good for a man whose paternal grandfather AND paternal uncle both committed suicide.  I am dedicated to my conviction that the depressive streak stops with me.

Basically, it has helped me with the needless worrying and I'm not so high-strung when I'm on it. Literally, it's a ""chill pill"". As far as improving concentration, no help. Every now and then I take a couple of days off to see what happens and the above occurs. It sucks that I have to rely on this but grateful that I have it."

It is unlike any of the dozens of other antidepressants I've taken over the years--it gives me energy and makes it easier to get up in the morning!  Please note that I only take the brand-name of this drug--I had severe reactions to the generic version (complete meltdown). I took the brand name for many years with no problem, but the generic felt like a completely different drug.  In reading these reviews, I wonder how many of the people with severe reactions were taking the generic version opposed to the brand name. According to my doctor, I have severe side effects to the buffering agents used in many medications. Just wanted to put that out there for consideration.

I have tried many anti-depressents, some worked but lost their effectiveness after years of taking them.  I have been on Wellbutrin SR for about a month.  I also take another anti-depressent with the Welbutrin.  Before taking Wellbutrin SR, I had no motivation and no interest in life.  This has changed dramatically and includes a lot more energy.  This is incredible.  The down side is I have been having increased insomnia and a funny feeling in my head when lying down and when looking up.  It does go away during the day.  This is unsettling and hope it subsides.  I am not giving this up for the reasons I have stated.  The Wellbutrin out ways the side effects.  Hope this helps.

During inpatient at a psych ward, the psychiatrist put me on Wellbutrin SR. I've been on it less than a month and it's definitely working! I have so much more energy and motivation. It did increase my anxiety and I had quite a few of the side effects. I stuck through them and glad I did. I feel like such a weight is off my shoulders! My whole family/friends noticed a major difference in me. To all those complaining about side effects: every medication will have them. If you are truly eager to let a medication do it's job, you need to be taking it for AT LEAST 2 weeks to see the full effect. Don't be quick to give up on this medication. Suck it up, stick through it, and it will definitely pay off in the end. I am extremely happy with this medication so far. Switching from Effexor XR to Wellbutrin SR was the best choice I've ever made in my life!

I took citalopram for 2 years and it really helped but disc after 2 nd trimester when advised by obgyn. I was put back on citalopram (celexa) after nursing my daughter and it really jacked me up. Migraines, excessive sweating, extreme fatigue, No sex drive whatsoever, on edge, vertigo was worse, increased appetite, increased sensitivity to light. However, I slept like a baby as I have been sleep deprived since third trimester in pregnancy. Too uncomfortable, lol. My dr put me on Wellbutrin after I described the side effects. I was hesitant because I did research and its not a drug commonly used to treat anxiety. At first I suffered headaches for a few days following the switch. In the first week I was wanting to get off. I had agitation, I said whatever was in my head (which isn't my style, I'm non confrontational), I felt detached, like I was going through my day with some ease but it wasn't me, i had no real joy. My chest would hurt and my heart would race, nothing new, i have that dealing with GAD in general.I had less patience (which is also unlike me). On the upside, I Loved my new ability to focus and remember things (what a blessing to Moms), and I had energy throughout the day! My sex drive is in full force! I have more joy now, I can live in the moment and it has helped with my anxiety.

Been having some vivid dreams but they're not a big deal, more interesting than anything else. Appetite has decreased -lost 5 lbs in just over 2 weeks)which is fine by me! Dry mouth, yes, but just drink more water. It's good for you anyway. Constipation? Yes, but just eat an apple or more veggies/fiber.  Overall, I'm very happy with it and feel healthier in general.

I also have dry mouth from it which was really awful at a higher dose (450mg) and did have funny feelings in my head when trying to go to sleep at that dose.  Adjusting to the Bupropion I did experience heart racing, et cetera.  Right now I am taking 200mg.

I started drinking and had all the symptoms of bipolar. With this medication I sleep at night, have become a much better person and parent. I have no side effects. I stopped smoking- not because of this medication - I used patches but this finally made me care enough to want to stop and I care enough to want to be better which is the greatest benefit of all. I've tried to stop it a couple of times and it was always a disaster. Finally recognizing that I need this and taking it everyday has helped tremendously. I've  been on for about ten years now except for those times when I thought I was well enough and tried to say I was okay and stopped for short periods. No more stopping. Different pills work for different people. This one works for me. People like me now!

It's been almost a year and a half since I've had a full week where I wasn't up all night long at least 1 night and up to 3 nights a week until I started this med.

If I misses a dose I actually got nic fits (shorter temper, jumpy, edgy) and if I took the skipped dose and grit my teeth for a half hour I was back to the easy going.

I have not been on the drug long enough for the side-effects to subside, so I am toughing it out.

I didn't care about anything or anyone. I was very hostile, angry, and snapped and anything. I reached a point where I wanted to put my fist thru someones face and I was waiting for someone to piss me off. This drug made my PTSD overwhelming and I was seeing things and the images of the warzone was always popping up. I was seeing the flesh rotting of peoples faces. Worms, maggots, snakes crawling out of thiers eyes, nose, ears & mouth as I was talking and looking/ talking right them. My night terror dreams left me screaming until I would wake my hearing impaired wife up. I lost over 25 lbs and nearly lost my mind with this medication. My wife, son and daughter were in constant fear of setting me off. I wouldn't recommend to medication to anyone. It was like my brain was on fire and my thoughts were racing a 1,000 mph. I so badly want to crash my truck in a brick wall at 120 mph to put a end to this madness. I have been taking meds for over 9+ years to treat my depression, socail phoia, anxiety, panic attacks, trouble sleeping. I feel that after a little two weeks of taking this pill at 150mg twice aday that my menatl state is even worse then ever before. This medication has triggered some veterns with PTSD to kill and kill themself. If you have PTSD or know someone who does please stay away form it.

He also said to continue smoking up until the beginning of week three.  I did, but honestly after a few days of even the 150mg/day I felt the need to smoke significantly less, after two weeks quitting was incredibly easy.  Had some ""nic fits"" but nothing so strong that I couldn't handle.  I was a pack a day smoker for 20 years and this is the first time I had been able to stop.

Personally, I had a little trouble sleeping the first week or so until I got used to the drug.  Since then I've had no real problems with it at all.

I do need to mention that I started this with my girlfriend and she had a completely different reaction.  After a few days of taking the exact same dosage she began to act very hostile and began having uncontrollable crying fits at random.  She has not been able to sleep a full night for some time and has stopped taking it because the side effects were very strong.  She did manage to put up with them long enough to break the nicotine addiction, but the side effects were very scary and I would never want her to take it again."

507$Condition: Depression$1/24/2012 9:43:58 AM$Reviewer: COF momma, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$4$5$I started taking the generic form of this med in August 2010.  Originally, it was given to me to help with anxiety and overall being overtaxed with the cares of life.  It took about 2 weeks to really start feeling a change.  I typically have seasonal affective disorder; so, this medicine was extremely helpful during the fall and winter months.  I stopped noticing much of an impact in the spring; so, I gradually took myself off of it and did fine through the summer.  I went back on it in September 2011 when I felt the symptoms of depression and anxiety start to creep back up on me.  In the winter, I could gain 20 pounds EASILY but since I started taking this medicine, I have lost 30 pounds and actually feel motivated to take better care of myself (which is required to take the best care of my family).  Overall, this medicine has been very effective for me.  The only drawbacks I can see are that, after a while, I stopped seeing any effects of it (during the warmer months).  I also had extreme bouts of sweating and some insomnia.  I have some occasional dizziness as well.  But as infrequently as I have any of these side effects, this medicine is still very much worth my time and money.

The beginning was fine, and just the waiting game for it to kick in. At about 3wks I started feeling more than just the dry mouth, the headaches were horrible a few hours into the med, been having to take laxatives for the constipation, which at 21 is a horrid reality. The kicker for me is the nausea the constant cruddy stomach feeling, I dont eat because I am not hungry, but then the pain worsens as it generally does when you dont eat. If I try eating, I feel sicker to my stomach afterward. The dr just upped my med from 100mg 2x day (am,pm) to 150mg 2x day, I am praying (and I am not religious) that this gets better. I'll update later on if symptoms clear up. best of luck everyone.

I was very nervous to start taking it after reading all of the horror stories about side effects. However I had no bad side effects other than some constipation and it made me tired. I was on Lexapro for a little over a year before this and while it did help, it made me very zombie like and emotionless. And after awhile it didn't seem like it was helping anymore. (weaning off Lexapro is not fun either!) I know it's too early to tell if the medicine is working or not but I notice that I am happier. Most things I used to cry about don't upset me anymore.

I take 150 mg twice a day. I can honestly say that so far it has improved my daily attitude and certainly is helping me deal with my depression.  I also have experienced some weight loss, and some constipation.  At first this medication gave me cotton mouth as well, but I am into week 3 and that seems to have deteriorated.  
Even some of my longtime co-workers notice a difference in my attitude.  Also I think I myself am trying to change the way I think and this medication only helps me to do that.  I sleep better than  I did before taking this, and the dreams like other people have said are very vivid.  They aren't nightmares but they are easy to recall.  Hope this helps for some of you with worries about taking this.  May not be for everyone, but so far it has worked well for me."

I suffered a severe neck injury( 3 surgeries) that rendered me disabled way before my time. Became depressed after I had to resign my job and give up golf and other activities that I loved. I tried several other meds but between the constant pain of my injury and the depression I could barely get out of bed. My Dr. put me on wellbutrin sr 100 mg twice daily at first and it helped for awhile before I fell back into a rut. Then he suggested 100 mg prestiq ALONG with the wellbutrin and everything just clicked. I know that this may be an strange combo but I also know that it has worked wonders for me ! I have proof every morning as my first hour of the day is still brutal until the medication takes hold. I now have the energy and resilience to face each day in a positive manor. A little wordy here but if I can help just one person it's worth the extra typing. I now have a renewed and much needed energy level and feel light years better than I had before.

It worked excellent for me. However, last week (7 days ago exactly) I switched to Wellbutrin SR, 100mg in am and 100mg in pm, secondary to significant sexual difficulties experienced with Zoloft. I started Wellbutrin SR to also treat ADHD, hoping that it was a ""bang for my buck"" type med. As of this past week I have been experiencing side effects of agitation, shakiness, dizziness, and emotional. At the same time I have been significantly functional completing my daily tasks and then some. I have been able to go to BJ's and not feel overwhelmed and actually focus on my grocery list!!! One of the major issues I am experiencing is a very odd ""electrical shock"" type feeling upon movement. I have experienced this before if I missed several doses of the Zoloft, so I am wondering since I have recently switched, is this the side effect of not having Zoloft in my system or the Wellbutrin SR?

Now on wellbutrin and only started 3 days ago. I noticed jitters and just a overall sicky feeling in my head. i take (100mg 2x) 1 in am than 1 in pm. i lost 3 lbs already. which i havent had constipation like most patients. i notice energy after my head feels better later in day after am pill. but i normally have to take a nap in mid afternoon to help with the jitters and sick feeling. I have slept better not sleeping all 12 hrs of day away like in last yr. I get up and start the day with energy for house chores but only have the energy till i take the am pill than I seem to loose the energy and the jitters and shakes come. i hope the best on this and pray the side effect goes away like today but i understand takes time. I do believe with losing 3lbs already and energy increase this will work out. Also I have to say Im a bit more short temper with wellbutrin right now too. Feel that should go away too. Im to stay on 2x 100mg until further doc. tappt. in next 4wks. I will update after my appt. I hope to help others believe me I have switched it up 3 time in one yr. before going on effexor. now im on another path to try and turn around bad side effects of weight gaining from effexor.

However, Wellbutrin made me constipated and dizzy, gave me extreme dry mouth and headaches, and made me feel feverish and exhausted for about two hours a day, every day. Worst of all, it made me incredibly anxious and nervous. It may have actually made me feel worse. After a month, I went back to my Dr and I've been off of it for a week and a half. Now I'm vomiting and I'm even more constipated than I was before.

I have finally weaned myself off of the Wellbutrin gradually as it caused trouble sleeping which then required that I take 2mg of clonazepam. My dreams were so vivid and weird. I would be running and running all the time and wake up exhausted. I'd dream about people I hadn't seen in 20 years who I barely knew. Wild weird dreams and extrememly vivid. I have been able to cut my clonezapam down to 1mg and hope to gradually wean myself off of that as well. I hate taking a narcotic to offset the effects of the Wellbutrin. It did pull me out of a severe depression which was the lowest point of my life but I hope to make it without it. I waited until after the seasonal fall depression was over before beginning my withdrawal of the drug. I had attempted to quit smoking and my doctor gave me a stop smoking medication.

I was on tricyclics for a while in my late 20s (horrible side effects), and then the SSRIs (first Lexapro, then Celexa). The Lexapro had NO effect on me. The 20-mg Celexa made me sleep 12-14 hours a day (seriously), gained 7 pound in 1 week (ug), lost my motivation, lost what was left of my sex drive, and made me feel quite drugged. I insisted that my doc let me try Welbutrin. He put me on 75 mg generic Welbutrin SR. I feel fantastic! My energy is back, I am starting to get bursts of happiness, I smile more, my sex drive is creeping back, and I lost a couple pounds without trying.
I am SO happy that this drug is around because talk therapy and exercise was not enough for me. Depression is a genetic disorder that causes chemical imbalances in the brain. So you have to keep trying different meds - in my case, it was an imbalance in norepinephrine and dopamine, which is was Welbutrin treats."

This drug has turned my life around and is working better then I ever thought it would. Before taking the drug I was always tired, lazy, and just really not myself. I know the reasons why I felt like this I had a few pretty horrible personal issues and I just kept dwelling on them. Believe it or not this drug has given me my life back. I will tell you right now your sleeping pattern will change 100%. You will not sleep as well as you normally would but you also don't feel tired because you didn't sleep that well. For example I could sleep 8 hours before the drug now I only sleep 6 but have the energy like I slept 10 and the mood that all is well. THIS IS KEY!!! I HIGHLY SUGGEST you talk to your doctor and have him prescribe you e Klonopin or Xanex. I shouldn't say that but for my situation this drug can cause anxiety because it is a stimulant and every now and then you may need a benzo to calm down. Highly reccomend the combination of Wellbutrin and a benzo if your life is in the dumps at the moment

I was originally taking 300 mg when I first started using it about five years ago.  I really liked the way it helped with my depression.  However, I did notice an increase in anxiety with it, and the headaches were awful.  I took it for about four years and during that time felt better but sleep problems, headaches and anxiety were issues.  I cut my dosage down to 100 mg daily last year and added Zoloft 100 mg daily.  Headaches did not improve and overall feeling of well being decreased.  I am now off Wellbutrin and just on Zoloft 100 mg daily. Since I stopped taking Wellbutrin I've gained 20 pounds (I had lost 50 pounds over the four year period I took it, which I loved!).  Anyway, I'm debating taking the Wellbutrin again because I feel less depressed on it, and have more energy but I hate the thought of going back to severe headaches and more trouble sleeping (even though I have headaches and trouble sleeping all the time due to Fibromyalgia).  I do take clorazepate to help sleep and that has worked nicely without the hangover feeling of other sleep meds.  Does anyone have any suggestions as to how to deal with the headaches if I start taking the Wellbutrin again???  Thanks!

By the way, this drug is a mild stimulant so don't take it close to bedtime.  That will help with the insomnia.

Originally on celexa 40mg and lamictal 200mg.  Had trouble with concentration and short test proved attention-deficit problem.  Weaned off celexa and went on Wellbutrin 2 months ago.  I originally felt increase surge of energy, cleaning house, etc but also felt angry and hostile and not sure why, could not pinpoint my aggression.  Went back to doctor and he added 20mg of celexa back to the Wellbutrin.  Everything was great after that.  My mood and emotional well being was great.  Yes in the beginning of taking med, had nausea, stomach pain, alot of constipation mainly and that ""electrical current"" feeling everytime I turned my head. After celexa added to Wellbutrin I was ok within 24 hrs.  Side effects do get better. Feel like this is a good drug if you have depression, bipolar and attention problems.  Each person is different.  Doc will review all your meds and history and determine what is right for you.  If some medicine doesn't work after a few months then say so and request an adjustment.  I am doing fine now.  Good luck."

I have read most of the comments and I am now more afraid than ever.  I have always suffered from some mild form of depression, but never got help for it.  I am taking this drug to help me stop smoking, but I am afraid of how it is going to affect me.  I can't afford any of the horrible side effects, as I work in a very dangerous occupation and must be mentally alert at all times.  I am willing to try this drug, but at the first sign of any negative effects I will have to stop taking it.

565$Condition: Depression$5/29/2010 6:20:12 PM$Reviewer: quatchisaurusrex, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$4$4$"I first tried Wellbutrin about a year and a half ago for a clinical trial, and it was pretty bad: the doctors had me start at 150mg and tried to push it up to the max dose in about a month, and then threw on a mystery drug (which turned out to be Lexapro) on the side for another two months. That was rough: the first few days of just Wellbutrin, I was an insomniac. It got better with time, but when Lexapro got added to my ""treatment"", I became such a zombie that I failed my classes that term. I was headachey, couldn't move, didn't want to...it was worse than my depression.

Now my doc convinced me to retry Wellbutrin, so I've been taking 75mg for the past couple of weeks. It's not bad. The first couple of days it felt like I was on speed or something because I was really hyper and jittery, but it's calmed down. The only thing I really notice is that I don't fall asleep until about 2 in the morning, and I sleep through my alarm clock (9am). I also had headaches for a couple days as well, but I can't blame that or anything else solely on Wellbutrin, as I'm taking BC along with it, and it's allergy season and I get really headachey during that. 

I'm a bit disappointed in the reviews I've found here though: some of you aren't giving your body enough time to get used to it before you start ranting about how you're going to get off it. Obviously if it's put you in the hospital already then yeah, you should find something else, but for the rest of you complaining about not being able to sleep/think/whatever since you started three days ago...BE PATIENT!"

I took it for about 5 weeks and then stopped (with permission from my doctor) because it slammed me into serious depression, I was super emotional and tired all the time but it did nothing to slow my brain down, or to help me focus and prioritize to make rational decisions. Basically, it did absolutely nothing for my ADHD symptoms and it's funny how my doctor put me on this because she was worried about me going into mania if I was on a stimulant yet being on Wellbutrin did the exact opposite, in fact it was the first time in my life I have ever felt suicidal.

While I don't know how it has made a difference in my libido, I have found that I have more energy, more focused, happier.  I even laugh at myself now.  I didn't expect this medicine to work so quickly, but it is almost amazing.  The first 3 days I took it only once in the morning and then on the 4th day in the morning and evenings.  As far as side affects, the first 2 days felt some initial stomach discomfort, but this has passed.  Also when I increased my dose as instructed to twice a day, I noticed that at bedtime I was very awake, but not to the point where I couldn't fall asleep.  Also, the first two days of increased dosage I had disturbing dreams, but those two have stopped.  Also, I found it has curved my need to smoke meaning I smoke a lot less often.  Overall, I am pleased with this medicine and hopes it continues to work this well for me.

They all made me feel like a walking zombie.  All I wanted to do was sleep.  This is the only one, that boosts my energy level & makes me WANT to go out and do things.  I couldn't control my blood pressure with Wellbutrin XR.  Welbutrin SR seems to be one of a kind.  I do get surges of panic, but at least I can function on a day to day basis. That's the only side effect for me, so I'll take it.

I had VERY bad dreams where I was cutting people. I switched to Wellbutrin and the ""bad"" dreams went away. The dreams are still weird and very vivid, but i'm not slashing people to death. It starts out helping the depression but levels off. I don't think that much of it. On the medicine, you don't think much at all."
621$Condition: Depression$6/13/2009 1:52:37 PM$Reviewer: wildflower, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$4$5$I have suffered from depression since 1994 and had been on a variety of SSRI's and TCA's before being tried on Wellbutrin SR 10 years ago. I found the SSRI's and TCA's all had similar side effects with me, some lightening of the depression but I always seemed to have a crash when I was under stress that resulted in hospital admission for worsening depression and either suicidal thinking or an attempt. Initially my dose was titrated up to 300mg per day but I found I became very agitated and anxious at this dose and my doctor and I slowly decreased the dose to 150mg a day about 9 years ago which is the dose I have maintained. I found that I didn't have any crashes on Wellbutrin SR and I didn't feel depressed anymore. However I am a smoker and I never felt the urge to quit smoking or any reduction in my craving for cigarettes. This feeling of well-being continued until March of this year when a fill-in doctor prescribed 150mg a day of Wellbutrin XL instead of Wellbutrin SR.  Gradually over the last 3 months I have become more depressed and occasionally have suicidal thoughts. This surprised me when I started feeling this way again as there seemed to be no reason for it until I remembered that the doctor had changed my antidepressant from Wellbutrin SR to Wellbutrin XL. The drug manufacturer indicates that doses of the two drugs are equivalent and switching between them at the same dose should not result in any problems. However, in my case, I feel the dose of Wellbutrin XL would have to be increased to give me the same feeling of well-being that 150mg of Wellbutrin SR gave me. I will be switching back to Wellbutrin SR next week and expect that my feelings of depression will be history. As everyone responds to medication differently, there is no reason to believe that anyone else will experience the same effects that I did. However, it is something to consider if you are switched and find the same dose of Wellbutring XL to be not as effective as the Wellbutrin SR.
622$Condition: Depression$6/8/2009 6:45:15 PM$Reviewer: sdmlink718, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$4$5$I have suffered from depression and increasing anxiety for a very long time.  This is my first attempt with medication and I have had great results.  I have been on it for almost three months and I no longer cry everyday!  I am able to deal with my stress and I am able to confront issues that I am upset about instead of running away.  At first I had more panic attacks and had trouble with dizziness but that wore off after three weeks. Be careful driving for the first few weeks-I had problems with the dizziness and focusing about an hour after taking the pill. I also still have problems with my memory-forgetting important numbers and names.  I have noticed that I tend to feel anger and irritability if something is annoying me more so than without the drug.  I have lost 11 lbs so far and hope to continue with the weightloss.  I have had problems with insomnia but rememdy it with 1 Tylenol PM which helps tremendously. I quit smoking two years ago but now more than ever I can't stand the smell of cigarettes-hope I can get more accustomed to that soon.  This drug has improved my life so much-I am a completely new person and I am thankful that I decided to give it a try.
623$Condition: Depression$6/7/2009 1:13:08 AM$Reviewer: grparadox, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$4$I have been taking this drug for depression for 4 weeks now.  Initially, I had uncontrolled crying spells, increased energy, and loss of appetite.  Now that it has stablized, I have energy, have lost 20 bls, decreased from 2 packs to 1 pack of smokes a day, have a pretty good feeling of well being, no crying spells, my emotions are in normal range, and I am getting my libido back gradually.  I am currently taking 300 mg daily (150 mg x2).  I was taking Zoloft with Lithium before.  Now I take Lamictal for my bi-polar.  A previous review mentioned that no drug is a cure all for depression. I believe that we can manage our depression with medication and therapy.  We just have to find the right one that works for us.  Never give up hope. Never. What works for some, doesn't necessarily work for all.  That is why these forums are here, to help people.  Wellbutrin Sr, had some side effects intiially, but like the literature stated that came with my bottle, the doctor thought the effects of the drug out weighed the side effects.  I have tried several medications in the past 8 years.  At least for me, I was told to give a medication 4-6 weeks to see if it is going to work, unless you are having sever side effects.  Obvious side effects aside.  Wellbutrin is not the cure all for everyone, but it seems to be working for me pretty well.  I have my life back. I can get out of bed in the morning. I want to walk my dogs, exercise, go shopping, eat, and just plain live.  Before I did not, and attempted not to.  So best wishes to all.

I started with Zoloft after the birth of my first child, and then switched to Prozac and back to Zoloft. It worked well for me until recently. I started having anxiety attacks( which I had never had before) and I became very irritable. The doctor changed me to Wellbutrin SR, and I've been taking it for about a week. The first two days it was like I was on speed or something. I had more energy than I've had in years. I cleaned (really cleaned) my house for two days straight. Third nothing unusual, fourth day very sick (possible reaction from other medications). Today, I feel kinda foggy, jittery, and dizzy. Not sure if it is the medication or the medication with coffee. I had two cups which normally wouldn't bother me, but wondering if I shouldn't drink with this rx. So far, side effects aren't anything I can't handle. Hoping the dizziness tapers off, but hope the energy stays.

I've been taking it for about 2 months still have the insomnia(but had it before started taking it, just got worse), I still have some bad days, just no where near as bad or as many, i have noticed shortened temper where little things set me off, some lil things make me wanna cry, i am dealing with somethings a lot better, but actually started smoking more, have the jittery feeling but its manageable, have noticed i have started talking a lot more, used to be quiet(not really a good thing for me). It is a good medicine has helped a lot, just has some side effects. I am taking Budeprion SR 150mg 2x daily. Was hoping it would help me stop smoking by now, and the insomnia mixed with crazy dreams would go away but it hasn't yet.

628$Condition: Depression$5/19/2009 11:35:55 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$4$5$I was on wellbutrin for 3-4 years for depression and it worked great.  The first several weeks were hell- I was already severely depressed, and once I started the wellbutrin I couldn't eat or sleep.  So if you're about to start taking it, try to have someone in your life watching out for you, because the first few weeks can be really unpleasant.  After that it controlled my depression perfectly, and as a bonus I lost some weight.  I'm not taking it now because after several years it started to affect my cognitive abilities (couldn't think of words, etc.), and I'm on celexa instead, but wellbutrin worked so well that I might even risk the cognitive effects to go back on it.  The longest-lasting effect was not being able to stand the smell of cigarette smoke- it's been over a year since I stopped taking it, and I'm just now becoming ok with walking past people smoking on the street.

I went thru years of excuses for the way I felt.Until I was at the point of just waking up in the morning took every ounce of energy.

I don't feel the depression everyday as I used to and it is no where as bad as it used to be. Overall, it is great to take if you give it a chance.
632$Condition: Stop Smoking$5/3/2009 7:48:38 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$3$4$This med does curb the cravings to smoke, but the side effects are very rough for me. I feel very nauseus most of the time, can't eat at night if I want to avoid the nausea. Also I have had trouble sleeping, my heart rate increases every once in a while, and I'm always tired. My doctor said this is because of the medicine. I have to admit, this will help me quit smoking becauses the faster I can get off this medicine the better!!!! I have lost a couple pounds though, mostly cause I'm afraid to eat! Its not this bad for everyone, just depends on how you can deal with the side effects.

635$Condition: Depression$4/1/2009 10:45:25 AM$Reviewer: stokcarr2, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$4$5$If you suffer from depression AND anxiety, I would recommend taking Wellbutrin along WITH an SSRI (Prozac, Lexapro, Paxil, etc.). If you already have anxiety, Wellbutrin alone will make it worse. I took Wellbutrin for 3 years, and then started experiencing severe anxiety, heart palpitations, jitterness, etc. I went off Wellbutrin and started taking Prozac. The Prozac works, but of course then you have the weight gain and the decreased libido. I read here on WebMD that you can take Wellbutrin along with SSRI's, and it will actually increase your libido and will help control your appetite. I tried the two together, and it works! My sex drive came back within two days (yes, two days!), and my appetite has significantly decreased. I think the combination of the two (Wellbutrin and Prozac) brought me to exactly where I need to be!

637$Condition: Other$3/14/2009 5:41:00 PM$Reviewer: BeCareful, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$I was probably mis-diagnosed. My family care doc put me on Wellbutrin SR for anxiety/depression. What it did was take my anxiety and make it 1000x worse! Wellbutrin increases dopamine, which if you're depressed is a good thing, but it made my racing thoughs a thosand times worse. I thought I was going crazy. All I could try and do was make it until night-time when I could take my Ambien and get a few hours of sleep. If you're just depressed, it may work great, but use EXTREME caution if you've got anxiety as well as it sent mine spiraling totally out of control.

For the past year I have put on ALOT of weight, which wasn't normal for me.  Since I have depression, had the weight gain, feeling fatigued and smoke, my doctor started me on 150 mg of Wellbutrin for the morning and 10 mg of Lexpro at night.  I have only been doing this for 1 week. I have noticed a decreased in appetite on some days. I haven't seen a difference or a urge to quit smoking yet, I actually may be smoking more than usual because of the following. I do have the jitters, its like I drank too much caffiene. I do see a bit of an energy increase, but I would like it to me more. My sleep is fine, but I do take Klonipin, so don't know how I would be without that. This combination has been good so far.

647$Condition: Depression$1/31/2009 9:52:36 AM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$3$I have been taking generic Wellbutrin SR 300mg for just alittle over a month. I had heard only good things about it and how much everyone liked it, so I thought I'd give it a try. The first week when I was taking 150mg I had so much energy and really felt good, plus it decreased my appitite. Then I went up to 300mg and my energy level tapered off which wasn't bad, my appitite came back which wasn't good, and I was more depressed, moody, agitated..just all around a bitch. It was like I had PMS everyday and I would be mad and not really know why. So, I am now in the process of weaning myself off it taking 150mg a day instead of 300mg. I haven't really had any withdrawal problems. I guess because I haven't been on it that long. I go back to my doctor on Monday and will have her put me back on Effexor which is what I was taking before and I love it. The only reason I quit taking it was because my health insurance changed and I could no longer afford it, but I found out it comes in generic now and is alot cheaper. If anyone else has had the same problems that I have experenced on Wellbutrin please let me know, because everyone else  I know that is on it thinks it is so great and don't understand why it isn't for me.

I've been on Wellbutrin SR for almost 2 months.  I transitioned to this from Zoloft (taken on and off for 3-4 years).  I switched because Zoloft drastically increased my appetite and I began gaining weight.  I have had some improvements on Wellbutrin including: weight loss, increased energy, getting out of bed much easier, return of sex-drive, and more motivation.  I did have insomnia when I started the Wellbrutrin.  That has gone and I actually think I'm sleeping better than I have in years.  I have also experienced some minor upset stomach from time to time, slightly shaky hands, and weird/stressful dreams.  The only concerns I have are that I am starting to feel a little paranoid and I tear up extremely easily.  I haven't started any uncontrollable crying but I'm afraid I might.  I am having monthly check-ups with my doctor so I can voice my concerns.  I also think it is very beneficial to seek out the help of a psychologist/psychiatrist.  Overall I am pleased with the progress.  I'm very close to finishing up a PhD and this has greatly improved my productivity and motivation.

As the days went by, the side effects lessened in intensity, most have gone away entirely. I have not experienced the heightened sexual desire yet! I still have hope! My advice to all who are struggling is to hang in there and let the meds stabilize in your system. For the review of the lady who is angrier then normal, were you on another antidepressant? If so you may need to take both for a while, ask your doctor.

You will have all the side affects mentioned, but once it gets into your system it works great. All the side of effects seem to go away. I still have muscle aches every now and then. I had problems sleeping two, so my doctor put me on trazdone. It is wonderful, but you have to get a full eight hours sleep when using this drug. All the meds combined seem to be working for me. I did notice that I do have weird dreams sometimes, but overall I would change the meds. I would rather put up with my dreams then to be taking off my meds.

Here is what is happening to me.....I am having very crazy dreams when I am sleeping (which is very little),I am very mean and aggressive (which is very rare for me),I am driving everyone at work and home crazy because I talk more than I ever have before, I have dry mouth and I have a flushed and nauseous feeling. I am going to give it one more week to see if it works. I hope to still have my job and my husband at the end of that week

I can go most of the day without smoking. It is a great product if you don't experience the side effects. I am having trouble in that area. I feel dizzy, muscle aches and pains, and I feel nauseated most of the time. I am not sure I want to take this medication anymore. I have been on it for a week and none of the side effects are deminishing.

The switch over from celexa to wellbutrin was bad....I attempted suicide. Doctor said to stick with and a continue on my celexa. Does anyone else take 2 depression meds at a time? Also, I can not sleep, I am awake during the day but I feel like I'm going to crash eventually. I am getting about 4 or 5 hours of sleep a day. I normally sleep at least 10 and nap after work.

Seasonal Affective Disorder.  The first 6 days I was very foggy, with a lot of somewhat sad thoughts and a lot of jittery-ness.  The past 3 days I have been pining over old regrets, and mistakes I made a long time ago.  Perhaps the medicine is adjusting my focus level.  The fogginess has gone, but I am struggling to get to that 3-4 week threshold when I hope to feel better.  Winters in New England suck, and I feel like this year started early.  Hoping that things kick in and make me more level.  I plan on getting off of the Wellbutrin come spring, when the clouds always clear.  My energy level has been normal, but the jitters have been irritating.  I will review again later.

For a while, I wasn't sure if it was helping or not, but while I've been on it, I've had fewer panic attacks and have been able to deal with stressful situations in a much more collected manner.  It has also helped with my depression symptoms (I sleep better and am less distracted).  As a full-time college student, it was important to me that I only take long-term medications with minimal warnings about missing a dose once in a while, and I've never had any problems when this happens.

Overall, I have had a positive experience with Wellbutrin and have noticed no negative side effects."

My depression has improved immensely-I have no trouble getting out of bed and being motivated for the day.  Also a bonus is the return of sexual sensitivity and libido.  I had taken Paxil at one time and it totally eliminated sexual feelings.  Have also noticed it helps considerably with weight loss.  On Paxil I gained a lot of weight.  I am on 300 mg. a day and intend to stay on it-please give it a chance if you are having side effects-they are temporary!!

674$Condition: Depression$8/16/2008 5:23:32 PM$Reviewer: applefarmer, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$Nothing else I have tried has helped my depression like this - not Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil, Celexa, or Lexapro. And this does not have any side effects that I cannot tolerate. When you first start taking this, if it causes insomnia, shakiness, hand tremors, or nervousness - ask your Dr. to temporarily give you something to help you with these side effects so you can stick it out and stay on it for 6 weeks to see if it helps you. If my Dr. had not given me Ambien for the insomnia and Propranolol for the hand tremors, I would not have stuck with this long enough to tell that it works much better for me than anything else I have tried. Also, it is the only antidepressant that give me the side effect of decreased sexual sensation. Also, it actually greatly increases my libido! The only problem is that it made me constipated and every few yrs I need my dose increased and then the constipation comes back. So if you have this side effect, eat more fiber and drink lots of water and if that is not enough ask your doctor if you can take a stool softener the first month or so you are on Wellbutrin. Your body should adjust after you have been on this for 3-6 weeks and then you should be able to taper off the stool softeners and be fine. PLEASE insist that your doctor tell you how to counter any side effects and try this for 6 wks before you decide whether it is for you. I know 4 people who have been greatly helped by Wellbutrin when no other antidepressants worked or when the other antidepressants had bad side effects.
675$Condition: Stop Smoking$8/11/2008 9:38:20 AM$Reviewer: glitterfreak21, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$This medicine is the only thing I could use to stop smoking, tried everything else and got sick. I started the meds with 1 a day for 3 days and was fine, then I double my dose to 2 a day and well I started to feel some side effects like panicky feeling, confusion, and shaky, but I read about people experiencing this so I figured it was me getting used to the medicine and it was, cause after about a week I was fine, took the pill twice a day and it was like taking nothing, My want to stop smoking was more than the side effects, I figured if they wouldn't go away after a week I would stop but they went away. If you have some slight uncomfortable side effects, I would say give it a week, they will get better, but if you start experiencing a bad reaction then stop. I guess I'm trying to say don't be in a hurry to stop the pill when feeling a slight weird cause it just may be the adjustment. This pill was a lifesaver to me.

I am on 300 mg and going on to 400mg but so far so good.
I was on Zoloft and did not like it. I feel like it repressed my feelings. I still had them, it just made me zombie like.
But every medication is different. Zoloft works very well with my mother but not for me. 
Every body is different and some react to it different.
Im happy with it. I havnet felt this great in over 10 years.

Originally I was perscribed a twice daily routine but once daily was actually more effective for me. As far as side effects at first it actually decreased my appetite tremendously but that wore off over time. The biggest thing to remember with this drug, or any antidepressant, it takes at least 4 weeks for the effects to really be seen. Also if the depression is being caused by a specific situation the drug is not going to fix or cure that situation. I have clinical depression and this drug has helped balance my body so that I can have a healthy or ""normal"" range of emotions. I still get mad, sad, and depressed at times because of different situations in my life but because of the med I can cope with them. Overall, the drug is extremely effective but please keep in mind no antidepressant is a ""happy"" pill that will all of the sudden make you want to go skippy through the fields. If you have a natural chemical imbalance it is extremely effective at helping create a healthy balance with minimal side effects."

697$Condition: Bipolar Depression$2/12/2008 10:17:04 AM$Reviewer: D String, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $4$3$5$"I settled on Wellbutrin after trying several other antidepressants, because it left me with a normal level of energy as opposed to the other meds, which made me feel like I was made of lead. I have been with it for about ten years, with Eskalith (now Lithium carb) and the combination stabilized my moods, with two exceptions. I got a heightened sex drive. If I was a male I couldn't have left the house! I brought that down somewhat with meditation, because as a single woman I didn't need it. The other side effect was an increased sensitivity to beauty, particularly music. Most of my adult life I had enjoyed classical music and opera, and played and sung myself. On Wellbutrin most ""good"" music, whether an aria or a touching country music song, opened a floodgate of tears in me and I had to simply stop listening to it. Today I can listen to topicly less personal genres, such as adult Christian music, but the high-powered stuff the young people are doing I sense as being too beautiful to bear. Also, when singing or playing an instrument for myself or friends, I have to choose my pieces carefully so that I don't break down when performing them or when hearing my friends perform them. As you can imagine, John Denver is no longer in my repetoire. Music has always been a part of my life, and I'm taking it back! Mostof my friends are into listening to or making music, and I want more! I'm preparing to step away from Wellbutrin and try one of the antidepressants that worked safely before and left me with more aesthetic self-control. "

I have been on many different depressions medications over a ten year period and found some were better than others but all had side-effects of some nature if it was skipping a dose or not eating,sleeping or more stresses arise all of a sudden to add to your burden of emotions has an effect on your daily drug. Wellbutin is good for weight loss or  quitting a habit like smoking but' that's it. It's an old school pill and Effexor or Lexapro should be given a test. It has helped me to change to new life when the more modern Doctors came in and put me on the new up to date drugs And, I've been though all depressions and mood swings has to offer in my disfunctional life of stresses. So Welbutrin rates low with no help to highten my mood level and I've to say change. A waste of many months with Wellbutrin.

I also take seroquel (25 mg) which takes some of the edge off the wellbutrin but not enough. I would have fits of rage in which I punched the wall until the skin split on my knuckles. I became a overtalkative nuisance to other people. I began to think they were plotting against me. I suffered from constipation, muscle twitches, seizure symptoms, respiratory problems, dizziness, fatigue, anxiety (there were many occasions where I was afraid to leave the house), and teeth grinding. It got to the point where I had to skip a dose every other day for me to calm down somewhat. My Psychiatrist recently instructed me to ween off the drug and start taking Lexapro. Though its too early to tell how the Lexapro's been working, I've been feeling more like Dr. Jekyll and less like Mr. Hyde lately.

For the last 2 years I've been battling with a pretty serious methamphetamine addiction. Before I had ever began taking meth (R.O.A. vaporizing in a pipe) I had battled with depression of variable severity, for almost as long as I can remember. I was also diagnosed with ADD as a young kid and was prescribed Adderall as a fix, but only took it for a short period of time (maybe 3 weeks if memory serves me right). The first time I ever used methamphetamine I felt as if I was a normal person for the first time ever. It allowed me to think clearly, express myself more easily, gave me the greatly needed boost of energy and metabolism (have always been slightly overweight), reduced anxiety and boosted mood. But of course what goes up must come down (especially when you get arrested). So because of added scrutiny from probation and the court system, I became desperate to find something that allowed me to A.)Not crave meth (the mental withdrawals are awful,and you WILL be severely depressed for a long time) and B.) Provide some relief from my baseline issues. *Now please note*
There is not clinical recomend treatment for methamphetamine abuse. But the few independent studies I examined listed Wellbutrin as one of the most effective M.A.T.'s. 
I am currently taking 40mg xR orally once daily, and by the 2nd day I instantly noticed a difference in my mental well being. Compared to how bad off I was and just completely unwilling to stop using meth, I would call this a miracle. And ironically the only other methamphetamine user I know that also has taken Wellbutrin reported similar success as myself, I would say it's criminal that they're not doing more research into using this or other similar meds to help curb methamphetamine addiction.

I have fairly severe C-PTSD with a lot of disassociation, flashbacks and I am prone to severe bouts of anxiety. I saw my psych when I could tell I was heading towards a depression spiral. I could feel all motivation slipping away, and as a college student with ADHD and finals next week she suggested that I try it. “It’s a super easy drug” she said; “it’ll be fine, what’s the worst that could happen?” I thought.

Literally every side effect it could have caused it did— and I only took it for a week and a bit. I didn’t sleep for days at a time. I saw things I knew weren’t there. I had trouble going to gatherings because I got panicky in crowds (never happened to me before. A friend who isn’t me said it was reminiscent of being stoned). I got super paranoid and anxious, was incredibly confused and couldn’t focus, and I felt like I was going to drop dead from a heart attack. Multiple friends stopped me to ask what I was on and if I needed help getting back to my dorm room because you couldn’t see the color of my eyes. But by far the worst part was that it made me incredibly, indescribably suicidal. I have been suicidal most of my life and had attempted before then but Wellbutrin made it 10000% more horror movie-esque. Instead of thinking about normal (??!?) suicidal thoughts I was so out of it that I was seriously thinking/fantasizing  about super graphic imagery. 
But just to humble brag, during the Welbutrin hell week I still managed to get all As in all my finals.

Additionally an immediate family member tried Wellbutrin with eerily similar results.

****btw I want to make it clear that Wellbutrin works for many people, I think this horrible experience is more on the Dr than anything else. My next psychiatrist said it was “borderline malpractice” to put anyone on a new medication that wasn’t 100p necessary before a stressful time much less someone with my background.***"

Zoloft helped my depression but I had terrible nightmares that worsened and turned into night terrors/paralysis couldn't take it anymore. I've been on Wellbutrin XR 150mg for 4 days and already seeing an elevated mood, energy increase, overall feeling like my non depressed active self again and it feels amazing! The downside is that every day so far, 2 hours after taking it, I puke a few times and am nauseous almost all morning. I'm not a breakfast person so the first 2 days I took it on empty stomach, thought that might cause sickness but yesterday and today I ate toast with my dose - didn't make a difference. Today I also noticed a metallic taste in my mouth not sure if that's a side effect though. I'm 5 feet and weigh 117 lbs so I'm not sure if the dose is too much taking all at once, my Dr said it should be a good starting dose so idk. I'll give it a few more days before requesting dose change, definitely not giving up on it bc it's working!

I've now been on Par Pharmaceutical's bupropion 300 XL for about a month. Side effects are irritability and jitters, but I'm hoping those go away. I tried Activas 300 XL - oval pills - and it seemed to dump a large portion of the medication about two hours after taking it, giving me a zombie effect. It also gave me a headache. Those things may have gone away with time, but I switched back to Par.

726$Condition: Depression$2/25/2019 7:05:12 AM$Reviewer: Warox, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$"Firstly note this medicine not for everyone. Everyone's brain chemestry is different. It is one of the most popular and commonly used antidepressant due to it's general efficiency and fewer shitty side effects than other drugs. Personally, two weeks after starting 150mg bupropion, I'm already starting to feel somewhat better overall.

The way I've understood this drug works is by preventing the recapture of dopamine and noradrenaline. This leads to a slow but steady build up of those two chemicals in the brain. That' why the full efficiency of this drug is obtained a few weeks later after starting taking it. Dopamine is the feel good reward chemical which makes you feel slightly happier in general and makes you want to do things more since you're reward signal in the brain is ""boosted"". Not absolutely sur about the noradrenaline part but I think it's from this chemical adrenaline comes from. This could explain why this drug makes you more awake and energized than normally. Not sure but dopamine too i think helps keep awake. Anyways, even the specialists aren't exactly sure HOW antidepressants exactly works. 

 So far for me the first few days I felt a little ""something"" positively different about how I felt in general. I've been sadly having trouble to feel emotions and happyness for a very long time. Feel like a machine that mainly works eats and sleep. Now I'm starting to have more energy, want to do more things and actually enjoy myself sometimes. Better mood. I actually smile because I feel like it sometimes instead of smiling because I'M supposed to. Don't oversleep anymore. More sociable. Better attention and focus. Think better. Got some libido back. Losing fat and gaining muscle since im more active. Seems I'm actually starting to enjoy life a little. So far the pros are better than cons. Insomnia (i need seroquel to sleep well), rise in anxiety are the two downsides. A bit worst in the begining but it lessens. Got used to it. Definately worth it for me."

728$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$2/6/2019 4:59:28 PM$Reviewer: Mike, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$I had struggled with depression on my own before finally giving in and seeing a therapist. I resisted therapy and drugs for years- men are supposed to take care of their own problems....aren't they? Well a series of very trying and anxiety ridden events pushed me over the edge and on my way to getting help- I'm glad I reached out. After going over the options my doctor prescribed Wellbutrin extended release in a 150mg once daily dose (in the morning- don't take it in the evening or you will struggle to fall sleep). I have to say that this drug has really helped me. The very low, sad moods are gone, the fits of anger have subsided, I have more patience at work and with family, I haven't had a drink in months and I no longer think about suicide. I have a much easier time controlling my appetite, which with giving up alcohol, has resulted in a loss of about 20 lbs. My wife has remarked many times that I am 'nicer' now that I am on medication. I have to take her word for it. Seems I was stuck in a dark pit of my own making and couldn't figure a way to get out. I was going through the motions and was thoroughly miserable while doing it, and making everyone around me uneasy. This drug isn't a cure all for bad attitudes and badly lived lives but it can help, possibly, if a person is motivated to change. It will wind you up a bit- I do take a mild sedative at night to sleep. I have also found Wellbutrin to reduce libido but only slightly - this seems to run counter to many others experience. I have addressed that little problem by taking very small doses (7mg- 1/4 of a 25mg pill) of Viagra when the time is right. Otherwise there seem to be few negative side effects, at least for me. I don't like to take drugs but I recognize that Wellbutrin is very useful. Its off patent and I ask for the generic (Bupropion- inexpensive). At some point I hope to taper down and get off it but I could stay on it for a long time if I needed to and could live my life fully.

I had never taken anti depressants and my doctor recommended this one. It really made a huge difference in my mood and outlook, however it had one unbearable side effect for me. It made me soooooo itchy. I was losing my mind. I tried everything possible to control the itching, different soap, shower water filter, cortisone creams, numbing cream, ice..  nothing helped. I really wanted to stay on it and did my best to see if the side effect went away but it was excruciating.  As soon as I stopped it within a week it was better. But here I am almost 3 weeks after my last pill and I still get an itch attack all of a sudden Iâ??m the evening or the morning. I decided to write this down because two doctors told me this was an uncommon side effect for this medication and that maybe it was something else, but it definitely was the meds.

Curiously enough my dentist told me it was like an amphetamine!  But after being on this one year... it is not working anymore.  I'm crying alot, getting very irritable, yelling at people, angry, hopeless, unlovable... Its just plain not working for me at all.  I dont know if it is the lack of sleep or what.  but I cant do this anymore.  I dont know what to do now.  Called doc and I guess I have to go through the 6-week weaning off period to try yet another drug.  How am I supposed to work and be normal when I am not? I just want to feel normal without bad side effects.  I wonder why that is just not possible for me to attain normalcy? See? depression. everything is hopeless for me.

It doesn't give me the feeling that I HAVE to be doing something. I was able to go to work after taking it. Although I did have anxiety when talking to people at work. Mostly because I felt different. That feeling went away after 5 days. I never felt uncomfortable while being out and about. Just in case I feel I should let you know I started at 150mg for 4 weeks then went to 300mg. That is the normal way to start. Plus when I went up in mg I had no ill effects.

Unfortunately, the opposite happened. I took it for two months and found myself crying at everything, becoming very aggressive and short with the people around me which is very bad in a service career, and becoming more suicidal than I was before I took this medication. It worked amazingly for my friend but I did not metabolize it well at all. I switched to celexa and it worked a million times better. Luckily, I did not experience any nausea or skin problems with Wellbutrin like I did with my other antidepressants. Go figure

I usually take 150mg daily, but in mid-winter I take 300mg and sometimes I can go off it completely in the summer. It depends on stress, exposure to sunlight, exercise.

It also took away what little sex drive I had which Dr. said it wouldn't.  I went back to Dr. and he switched me to Wellbutrin xl titriting up to 300 mg after 150 for first week.

This drug has been a miracle in my life, it gives me time to notice red flags, like feelings of hopelessness, failure, dread, and wanting to die.. and so I can up my dose before things get out of hand..like in the past (suicide attempts etc). Give this med a try if you haven't had much success with some of the others! I've even lost weight on this medication because it gives me more energy.

I'm on 450mg of Wellbutrin and 300mg (150 2x a day) of Lamictal. No side effects so far. I can drink alcohol and smoke weed with it. (Not interested in other drugs so I'm not sure about those.)

I have had severe depression for about 10 years. Had been on prozac and effexor before wellbutrin. They both worked, but not even close to how the wellbutrin is helping me! I'm taking 300mg XL per day.

I felt so much happier even on day 1...  I couldn't believe how happy I was & still am feeling! I didn't know it was possible for a person to even feel this happy! (Not to mention the increased sex drive)!  ??

I also have severe fibromyalgia & social anxiety. Wellbutrin has helped all of it! I knew my effexor was not working for me any longer, since I had been on it for 3 years already.

I found myself gradually staying home from functions I would normally attend, was EXTREMELY fatigued & just wanted to stay in bed all day. My family told me I was very irritable. I didn't see it. I first had my hormone levels checked to see if that was the problem, The hormones were all normal.I called my psychiatrist the next day and started on the wellbutrin.

My family and I noticed a difference immediately, I was laughing again! It has given me an enormous energy boost! I have gotten things done that I've been meaning to do for the last couple of years, but could never do because of the lack of energy & motivation. I even started a part time job! It has suppressed my appetite, which I'm excited about, since I need to lose some weight.

I have never been happier than I am now! Please realize though that all medications don't work for EVERY person... our brain chemistries are all different, but I would most definitely give it a try! I wish you all the best & hope it works as well for you as it has for me.

There were minor side effects the first couple of weeks, (headaches & insomnia) but they went away and I couldn't be more happy or thankful for how much Wellbutrin has helped me!"

Wellbutrin has  been a God send. I have tried other anti-depressants too but they had bad side effects, low blood pressure, dizziness, dry mouth etc. Wellbutrin has none of these side effects for me. In fact, I have been losing weight prior to going on Wellbutrin so I specifically asked the doctor for something that would not cause me to gain weight. He wrote me the prescription for Wellbutrin with no substitutions allowed.It had to be brand name. I am pleased to say that I have not gained weight and I have been on this medication for over a year now. I am so happy to say this medication has performed well on all counts.

I was 35 for the first episode and the doctor gave me Wellbutrin.  It worked great and there were no side effects.   It stopped the deep sadness I felt.   The situation still stunk, but at least I was not a weeping mess.  I needed it for six months. The next event happened at age 47.  Wellbutrin helped again.  More bad news at 49 with depression and anxiety this time.  Wellbutrin is keeping me calm and less sad.  No side effects.
763$Condition: Depression$8/6/2016 1:32:17 PM$Reviewer: Lucky, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$5$"I was hospitalized for severe depression and anxiety almost two years ago. The doctor immediately started me on a low dose of Wellbutrin (the generic type), and upped it to 300mg before I was released. I went through four other medications for anxiety, since Wellbutrin often does not treat both depression and anxiety. Finally, I ended up with Zoloft, which also enhances the effect of Wellbutrin. Over months of treatment, the Wellbutrin was amazing! It lifted my mood, raised my energy, increased my focus, evened out my appetite, reduced my smoking, and increased my metabolism. With diet and exorcise on Wellbutrin, I was able to lose 50 lbs. Usually my metabolism is so low that I can eat olny salad with steady activity and lose nothing. So getting back down to a normal weight (122 lbs at 5'5"") was amazing. 
After 15 months of treatment, I wanted to wean off of the medications to see how I would do. I had been at the maximum does of 450mg of Wellbutrin and 200mg of Zoloft daily. After 5 months of no medication, I was spiraling down back to where I had started. It was hard to climb back out of that hole, but at least this time I knew the footing. I made an appointment with my doctor, and in the mean time, wanted to start back on the lowest dose of the pills I still had. Not expired, my prescription, all legal. The PROBLEM came when I mistook the dosage for each Wellbutrin pill, thinking they were 50mg each. Well, no, they were 150mg each, and I took three. Really, really bad idea. I felt the effects immediately, felt great, did work, a little shaky, knew I shouldn't drive so I didn't. That night, I got two hours of sleep. Took the same amount the next day, then realized my mistake. I haven't slept in three nights. I'm staying hydrated and being careful, not taking any more, but the point is: When taken correctly, it can amazing! DO NOT take more than directed!"

I still struggle with deep depression and anxiety. Due to the depression, I was constantly fatigued and couldn't concentrate. I was always sleepy. After taking Wellbutrin, it's helped tremendously. I feel like me again. I'm no longer constantly fatigued or sleepy. Unfortunately, I can't concentrate sometimes, but most times I can. As far as side effects, my doctor later instructed for me to take the medicine in the morning because it would give me insomnia. I'm relatively small so I need to have a good meal or drink lots of water or else I can get a bad stomach ache or even throw up. I also hear ringing in my ears at times.

After a traumatic event 6 months ago I was sick of crying, no motivation, anxiety, etc. I finally went to my family doctor she prescribed me Zoloft, and hydroxozine for anxiety. I noticed my depression and crying for no reason had subsided, but I became depressed in a different way because it made me so tired I could physically not do anything besides work. She switched me to Celexa and Cymbalta where I had the same problem and could hardly make it through a work day I was sleeping in my car at lunch.  About to give up I went to a Psychiatrist who recommended the generic wellbutrin. I started at 150mgXL for one week noticed absolutely no side effects.  The 8th day I started 300mg and noticed the energy a few hours later. I went grocery shopping, cleaned entire house, etc WILLINGLY.  Normally it would take me a week to have enough motivation to do one of these things. I almost cried I was so happy. I actually sat down and had a conversation with my boyfriend smiling and laughing- he looked at me crazy like he did not know how to respond because I have not been that way in so long. Now, I have only been taking it such a short time, but will definitely try 4-6 weeks for full effect.  I have had mild headaches (I had some before) a little dry mouth, and increased sex drive/orgasm. So far I am just thankful that it has put hope back in my life.

Was diagnosed with PTSD. I went through the gambit of anti-depressants/anxiety medications over the years. I had major side affects to all and was down to Wellbutrin or Zoloft. Tried Wellbutrin and it had been working great, minimal side effects, up to 250mg a day. Earlier this year I had sinusitis with fluid in my ears, doctor prescribed a steroid and Augmentin. Within 3 days I had a horrible, metallic taste in my mouth. Figured it was from the new medication. It was so bad I couldn't eat and lost 12lbs in 1 1/2 weeks. I stopped the additional meds and the metallic taste has subsided, but took about 2 months to clear up. Now I have a minimal lack of taste,(best example-I can't taste chocolate) a side effect of the Wellbutrin which is all I take now. I like this medication, it has helped make me myself before Afghanistan, but why am I having this side effect now after 3 years of use? My Dr. has stepped me back to 200mg, but I am pretty much out of options for other meds. Do I keep suffering not being able to enjoy food or come of the meds and risk feeling like the world is about to explode and I have to fight my way through it?

After contacting my doctor he took me off the meds and said to see an ophthalmologist as the drug could cause glaucoma. I went to the eye clinic and was tested and told I did not have glaucoma. But the doctor said my pupil was a little dialated and that could cause a focus problem.

I am someone who loves smoking, so naturally this was not what I wanted to hear.  I do suffer from anxiety a lot of times.  I went to see my general practioner who talked to me about the quitting of smoking and my anxiety.  She is a fan of the wellbutrin oral.  She said it will help with cravings and my anxiety that I face in general.  She put me on a dose of 150 mg.  She explained it could take 4-6 weeks to kick in, so I will most likely remain smoking for awhile until this has effects on me.  I am going into week 5...and have not had a cigarette in 5 days.  I smoked my normal amount up until 3 days ago and just like that..my urges have gone away tremendously.  The small urges I do have at times, I fight off mentally.  This drug has helped with the anxiety I've had and it just takes my mind off of cigarettes.  I have noticed I do wake up a few times during the night unfortunately and because of the broken sleep, I experience a very slight headache in the mornings.  It's a small consequence for me .

I had depression. It took all of my energy for the day to answer one email, and I would cry for no reason often. But after three weeks of Wellbutrin 150XL, I was whistling tunes I hadn't in years, and I was happy and energetic for the first time since I was a kid. At the same time, though, it's like my conscience switched off. I immediately started cheating on my wife of 9 years. Repeated hookups again and again with other men. I would prowl around town, horny out of my mind. It was like I was high. I would never have acted on these impulses before, not in a million years. Concerned that I was bipolar, I told my doctor and he screened me, asking if I was buying stuff. No? Then it must be because I was happier and more confident now. I should have insisted something was wrong, but the drug made me not care, plus my happiness made marriage great and she had no idea. I just wanted to keep going. That was 10 months ago. IF YOU GET IMPULSIVE BEHAVIOUR GET OFF OF IT BEFORE IT WRECKS YOUR LIFE. I hate what I've become. I don't know what's going to happen when I get off this cursed drug. I'm afraid all the time.

When I started the drug it gave me more energy and I felt more ""alive"".  I had a slight headache and a some insomnia at first but that got better after a few days.  I was somewhat short tempered at times but that is most likely the release of all the pent up frustration I had been harboring while depressed.

Wellbutrin helps with the kind of depression where you have NO motivation and crave sugar. It will make you dehydrated, constipated, edgy, and a light sleeper that only needs about 6 hours per night. It isn't good for anxiety and will not help it. During the adjustment period you could lose about 10 lbs and have the most vivid nightmares ever. This drug will stop working for you. At first you can be so numb but after awhile you start to feel very depressed again. It's not until you go off of it do you realize that it was helping. It really only seems to be popular because of the lack of weight gain and no decrease in your sex drive. Those are really the only positive things but you just have to figure out if the other side effects are worth it.

I have since my last baker act which was about a year ago. This antidepressant is the only one that doesn't make me gain weight, so it's the only one I will take. It causes dry mouth for me though and decreases my sex-drive. But, it makes me drink more water and I probably shouldn't be having too much sex anyway I guess. It's the best rx med I've found though since it doesn't pack on lbs. getting fat just makes me feel worse.
783$Condition: Depression$9/8/2015 9:07:24 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$FINALLY after a ten year ongoing battle with depression, severe depression and anxiety with panic attacks, I have finally found the right drug combination.  In the past I had a history of starting an antidepressant when things got really bad for me, noticed myself improving then gradually stopped taking it...then gradually fell back into the dark hole that felt impossible to get out of.  I have been taking different doses of Prozac for about the last 6 years ( which I also love when I stay on it ! ) and Celexa before that.. ( made me wayy too sleepy, counterproductive because when i'm depressed ALL i do is sleep ). This last time around, I had finally had enough, I wanted to pull myself together and stay on the medicine once and for all ( hey your Brain is an organ, and if you need medication stay on it! feeling great means it is working :) ) I went back on my Prozac ( 40 mg in Feb. when my depression was at it's worst, and anxiety= vicious cycle) and slowly noticed it taking effect, but not as effective as it was. My Dr. added the Wellbutrin ( 100 mg at first, now 200 ) and within 1-2 weeks I felt better than I have ever, ever. My motivation is back, determination, focus, energy, self worth and purpose all have returned, and gone are the days i feel lost, exhausted, and like a total piece of shit.  Talk to your Dr.! With these meds I've had a whole life style change, I was able to lose 30 pounds and counting, my binge emotional eating has subsided, i work out, went back to school and work like 50 hours a week! I eat great, natural, and organic foods that help fuel my body and mind, and do yoga to center myself.  ALl i needed was that little push, and at almost 30 I'm finally a better version of myself. Hang in there!!! I promise there is hope!

Even family members who were against me taking Wellbutrin have changed their minds after seeing me enjoy life again. I will not feel guilty taking this antidepressant (it is not a sign of weakness) I wished I had taken it years ago.

Its really has helped a lot. It does cause me too have a very dry mouth. Buy I was able to quite smoking too while taken it. Which I didn't expect. I told my doctor that I had finally quit and he told me that it was also used for too quit smoking too. I have tried for years to quit and have never been able too. Because of my nerves and panic attacks. I had panic attacks so bad I would hyperventilate. It was horrible. I'm really pleased with welbutrin and having a dry mouth I just chew a lot of gum.

It made me so I'll in so many ways I am lucky to be alive . I had so many of the side effects I can't list them all. At 52 I had never been to an emergency room until this horrific drug. Some of the side effects I had include waking up drenched in sweat (worse than any hot flash), with a splitting headache, I stood up and was hit with severe nausea and dizziness, made it to the bathroom only to collapse over the toilet where I sobbed uncontrollably for half an hour. This was the final incident that brought me to the ER, where all they cared about was whether or not I was suicidal. Do yourself a favor and Do Not take this drug under any circumstances.

Unfortunately I have made some poor decisions over the years, and being depressed so much seems obvious to me now, was a huge part of those poor decisions(as well as evidence in journals, and doctor notes to prove depression was ""at fault"").  I guess better late than never.  Its a relief to feel better, not cry every day, to feel good, or at least normal about yourself.

The side effects are with me, but I don't care! Just try to get on it slower if possible.  Don't cut the pills in half, I made that mistake, it can cause an overdose or seizures. I was lucky and wised up on that.

The reviews on this page have helped me a lot, and I want to thank everyone for helping, and the website for making this available.

I am 52 yrs old now, maybe now I can make better decisions, act better, listen better, whine less, focus more, eat less, care more, and be more appealing to myself and others.  Its amazing how so many things can be tied to and capable of working for you, when you get the help.

I hope you get the help sooner than I did, I waited way too many years to get this help, don't wait, at least give it a try."
795$Condition: Major Depressive Disorder$1/24/2015 12:21:13 PM$Reviewer: WonderAll, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$3$4$My first and worst severe depressive episode had me to believe that I would continue down into the hole I had built for myself. I couldn't see the bright side of a single word, my memory to include short, long, and working were gone, my concentration was shot, and I slept less than 3 hours a night for weeks on end and thus began to experience panic attacks. The first morning after taking Wellbutrin I woke up without shaking uncontrollably. The deep pit of despair was gone. I could still feel its presence because I had so often visited it, but my thoughts would not drag me down with them. The cold words began to bounce off of me. Wellbutrin felt like a shield. I was told it would take weeks for me to feel the effects, not one night, but perhaps I was so far gone that even the tiniest bit of change in my brain chemistry was enough to give me such a sense of improvement. The thoughts were still there, the negativity, Wellbutrin didn't get rid of the way I spoke to myself, but it allowed me to see doubts as lies, it gave me a way to fight back. It gave me a way to see all the put-downs were misconstrued. It took me about a week to understand that there were side-effects to using anti-depressants. I only took it for a month, but I am still feeling the effects. At first I had severe memory loss that had nothing to do with major depressive disorder and a strange emptiness and odd pressure behind my right eye. I also had periods where I would wander, go to the store, grab a coffee, talk to someone, and not remember, as if I had lost an hour of the day. Because I didn't take it for more than 5 weeks, I can't say for sure if the side-affects would have disappeared, but for that time there was also a strange psychedelic feeling, a sense that I had actually been drugged. I've never done anything recreationally before, but it was that feeling you get before being completely knocked out by morphine before a procedure, without the loss of pain associated with it.

Because of this accident, I suffered severe financial problems and major depression issues. I started seeing a Psychiatrist who prescribed Wellbutrin 150 Mg per day. (I was on Zoloft for 8 years prior to car accident) The first few days I was very jittery and had some bad anxiety. I felt like I was on speed. I then had massive insomnia for first 4-6 days. I also noticed headaches coming and going for first few weeks, but that has gotten a lot better.  THAT MAY SEEM LIKE A LOT OF SIDE EFFECTS, so if there's any advice or comments I can give, it would be to stick out the side effects for first few weeks. It will be worth the wait. This drug has changed my life in such a positive way. I began to get my energy back, sex life got 10 X better and I felt the way I did in my 20's. It's only helped my relationship with my boyfriend of 4 years and my 2 children.

I tried Celexa & EFfexor & quit them immediately due to side effects. I had to switch taking Wellbutrin in the morning bc at night it kept me awake & woke me often. I'm also a smoker & it has cut that back significantly. I had no appetite issues & no change in sex drive. I believe it helps get me up each day & keeps my emotions in better check. I am going through something that causes anger & sadness often. Lots of rants & crying spells but they have subsided & when they do happen it's less intense. It did cause me to be more anxious & I deal with high anxiety already so I am taking Busprione (15 mg 3x/day) on days my anxiety is higher but don't take it every day. 
My ONLY gripe is that on the 300 mg I feel as if my throat is closed all day. It's hard to swallow & feel l have to take deep breaths often. When my anxixety is high, it's much worse, sometimes nearly intolerable. BUT bc I feel it has helped me mood wise, I keep taking it. I'm tired of being a drug guinea pig & hope that this is temporary as I work through my situation. Hoping in time I can reduce back to 150 mg bc I didn't have the throat issue when I took that amount but for now I feel I need the 300 mg. "

I love love love this drug. I take 300mg once a day (I have friends who took lower doses, and it didn't work for them) and the first time I took it, I immediately felt better. I actually got a buzz from it the first time-like way too much coffee-but that disappeared the next day. I have no trouble sleeping while taking it, but it does give me constipation, to a degree-not too bad though. It also increases sexual desire, to a degree that might make it a woman's Viagra. Everyone's body chemistry is different, but I went from being a depressed, irritable witch, to being happy and mellow. I feel peppy, not terribly hungry, and happy. That's a big improvement, but I was never exceedingly depressed, except episodically, so I don't know if it's strong enough for someone with severe depression. It works for me though, and I really like taking it.

I'm currently on generic Wellbutrin SR, 150 mg twice a day (8 hrs apart). I have been on this medication for 4 weeks now, following a 2 week horror period on Lexapro. Wellbutrin isn't supposed to be effective immediately, but when I started it, I noticed a huge increase in energy and my ability to pay attention, my thoughts felt less cloudy and I felt more optimistic everyday. Those feelings faded a little after about 4 or 5 days (likely a placebo effect).
I have found that drinking alcohol while on this medication makes me turn into a totally awful person to be around. I would get mad at the slightest thing and be completely unable to get over it, no matter how hard my partner tried to help. I would basically shut down for the night if I drank, and would feel depressed for 2-3 days afterward as well.
I have been a self-harmer for about 6 or 7 years. While on this medication, I have only cut twice, but have become much more optimistic that I can stop my addiction to self-harm. I feel like life is more worth living in general and I tend to have a more positive outlook, even when there is some issue at hand. I don't feel like everything that goes wrong is my fault and I feel like I've become more productive and feel much more rewarded when I complete things. 
One other positive of this medication is that it has really decreased my appetite. I'm only slightly overweight at 5'4"" and about 145-150 lbs, but I used to eat all the time and now I don't usually feel like I'm hungry, even when I go half the day without eating. I eat more for taste and for health now than out of boredom. 
Overall I've had a pretty positive experience, and I will likely be switching to the extended release, 300 mg once a day the next time I see my doctor. "

Wellbutrin has worked well for me. However, has anyone had a very slight sore throat or a cold-like nasal feeling or a chesty cough as a suspected side effect of Wellbutrin? Am on 150 mg a day together with 100 mg of Sertraline. I have been on Wellbutrin for around five months and my symptoms have been with me for a similar period. One website indicated that 11% of side effects from Wellbutrin are sore throats. I have had other side effects e.g. constipation although this only lasted for say, 2-3 weeks. 

It would be helpful to know.

Thanks very much.

Although it gave me a little energy shortly after taking it, it didn’t really do all that much.  Also, in higher doses (450mg), it could make me emotionless and my hands extremely shaky, to the point that I could barely eat.  It helped me feel a little better for a while, but it didn’t really do much.  Keep in mind, though, that fifteen antidepressants have failed me, so I have a very stubborn case of it.

The wellbutrin, along with Pristiq, Valium, and Neurotin I am FINALLY myself!! I honestly thought my life was going to be miserable and I was a lost cause because I tried EVERY medication known to man and nothing worked. But the wellbutrin gave me the extra ""umph"" I needed.

I also have Graves' Disease and had my thyroid removed, that resulted in a paralyzed vocal cord which I have just had surgery to repair. I also have been through menopause. My doctor decided to change me from Zoloft to Wellbutrin 2 weeks ago.  The first few days I felt much better - more energy but  able to sleep better than I had in years. After the first week I was to increase to twice daily. Since then I have noticed dizziness that last all the time, unable to think clearly, words not coming out right,  hot flashes, and still having depression and crying spells at night time.  Not sure what to do.  I suppose I will give it a couple more weeks and then follow up with my physician.

At first, I had typical side effects and managed well - dry mouth, metallic taste in my mouth, trouble sleeping. I did experience the benefits of the medication almost immediately after starting to include increased energy. However, on the seventh day after the second dose, I had an allergic reaction about three hours later - due to, according to the doctor, the compounding effect of the medication. I began feeling itchy and had problems with my throat. I could breath and swallow, but my throat felt constricted and like I had a lump in the back. It was very scary and caused me to panic. I called emergency and saw my doctor, who discontinued the medication immediately. My throat is fine, but I still feel a little itchy. That will pass as the medication gets out of my system.

I share this because while allergies are rare, they can happen and if they do, call your doctor immediately. I know that everyone reacts to medications differently and am hopeful that my experience is unique and that others have a positive experience.

I still experience the depression, however it is less than it was. Also, the intense cravings for sweets is gone, though I have not lost weight as others have on Wellbutrin.

Considering the good experience I'm already having, I will continue with Wellbutrin. My doctor is working closely with me to make sure all goes well. I don't always handle medications well so we will see how this goes.

I was having an allergic reaction and ended up in the ER getting a steroid shot.  Know that if you start itching  you could also be allergic and at risk for anaphylaxis which is life threatening!
876$Condition: Other$11/2/2012 1:11:49 PM$Reviewer: LewieDewie, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$"I take Wellbutrin (generic) for help with the management of stress and I think its works wonderfully! I used to be in such a bad mood and so tired after work everyday which was not good for my kids or husband.  I also crave chocolate badly when I'm feeling stressed.  I take 100mg at 6:00 am and another 100mg at 2:00 pm and it makes a HUGE difference in my mood, energy level, and diminishes my cravings for chocolate.  I think the thing I like the MOST about Wellbutrin is how I now have energy ALL DAY LONG.  I used to be so tired all the time even though I was not depressed... the tiredness would actually MAKE me depressed at times.  Now I have enough energy that even after a long day of work I can make dinner, bathe my kiddos, clean up the kitchen, and do other house hold tasks that I was too tired to do in the past.

What I don't like about Wellbutrin is that it dehydrates me and causes a lot of muscle pain if I don't drink three to four 16oz bottles of water a day.  Juice, soda, etc, don't count either... it has to be water.  The good news is that if I DO start feeling muscle pain I just quickly drink 16oz of water and within an hour or two I usually feel normal again. However, the massive energy boost and the other positives of this medication make the extra effort to drink water worth it in my opinion!"

This is an amazing drug in terms of how quickly it starts working.  However, it WILL make some people lose their hair.  I am a 32 year old woman and used to have very thick hair.  In a period of 6 or 7 months I lost 1/2 of my hair, if not more.  No bald spots or anything because I discontinued.  (For those of you who are dealing with hair loss, yes it will grow back when you quit.  But it takes quite a while...  Here I am a year later and decided to try SR instead of XL.  Hair loss started once again within 2 weeks.  Decided to quit week 3 because my hair is still nowhere near as thick as it was before, even with it growing back.  This sucks!  Wellbutrin really is awesome.  It helps you lose weight and is awesome for your sex drive/orgasms.  Trying buspar now...

I had nearly every side effect possible. I was always nauseous, was very shaky, had ringing in the ears, and was disgusted by food. I had to force myself to eat, would eat a few bites and be full, and was hungry again in an hour, just to repeat the cycle. I was so used to not eating that much that one day I had completely forgotten to eat. By 9pm I realized it, forced some soup down, and puked it up within 2 hours. I started with 150mg and eventually up-ed it to 300mg. I wanted so much for it to work. After 5 months of no results I decided to go off of it. I had lost the weight I wanted, but was continuing to lose weight at a dangerous rate. I don't blame the drug; everyone's body is different and will have different reactions. Just wish it would have worked for me! Good luck to everyone and I hope you have better results than I did.

Obviously each person may have different side effects. I believe really wanting to quit smoking is key. These pills definitely make me unable to smoke when I freak and break down to have a Cig it is absolutely gross tasting and makes me sick. So after a few attempts its effects have made me not want one. The mental effect is weird Tho. I'm very mellow. My attention to detail is strange. I prefer a clear unmedicated state.  Can.'t sleep without sleeping aid. Also curbs my appetite so discourages me from eatting constantly in place of smoking and becoming fat. I think I'll contine a week or two at most. Keep busy and re do my routine to help my ""habit"". I think this pill works for quitting. IF you want to quit. Good luck to me and all! Choose life! Its hell its hard its hard as hell.

If I drink any caffinated drinks I feel alittle crazy wired, so I dont do that anymore. I do have more energy some days and others I am completely exhausted and dizzy. It also helped me quit drinking, I haven't had a drink since day one on this med, that alone makes it worth it. I did have a hard time sleeping the first couple of weeks, deal with it, it's worth it... My Dr. is starting me on Wellbutrin XL 300 mg once daily in the morning due to feeling tired, dizzy, foggy and still no focus.  I have memory loss, ringing of the ears, sensitivity to light (I now must wear a hat when going outside, and can't get sun on my skin or it stings like crazy for about an hour.  Oh well I have high hopes that this will work for me in another month or so.  No weight loss yet mabie on a higher dose. Been on this med for about 3 months.
932$Condition: Depression$9/6/2011 2:09:58 PM$Reviewer: Brainfog, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$5$I have been taking 200mg of buproprion for 3 weeks. I recently increased the dose to 300mg a day because I felt no reaction whatsoever to the medication. Although the very first week of taking it, I had suicidal thoughts for the first time in my life. But, that has gone away. Now I am having confusion/brain fog. I continue spelling that by writing taht. I can't spell very well at all anymore, and I had a grade of A+ in all my English classes. I keep seeing things running by me, that are not there. I forgot how to walk down my steps. I also take 300mg of Trazodone to sleep at night. I am suffering from depression, ADHD, and OCD. I hope it will kick in soon, as allot of people here have said it does. But for now, I'm going a bit crazy. But, I always forget I feel that way so it's not too bad. I also suffer from Grave's Disease for the past 11 years. That is what made me go to the doctor. I have no memory at all. I think it's Grave's, my doctor thinks depression. Whatever it is, I'm hoping for at least a little improvement.

Because of my sensitivity, many meds bother me. I was on Welbutrin SR 150mg once daily back in 2007-9, then slowly weaned off of it. My anxiety has returned and my new doc (accidentally) prescribed the XL... WOAH! It made me very very nauseous! However, now I am back on the SR and feeling GREAT again. It is the only thing that has ever helped me for any length of time, and it doesn't bother my stomach. Sure, the first few weeks are an adjustment (a little bit of dizziness, etc) but after that it really really works wonders for me. PS: I have tried Zoloft, Paxil, Prozac, and most recently Cymbalta - all of which either did nothing or made me feel sick or totally wacko. And the Welbutrin seems to relax me enough to where my IBS isn't as bad, and also lessens general pain (such as back pain). It's worth a try!!!

946$Condition: Depression$6/22/2011 4:50:43 AM$Reviewer: B-Ok, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$4$4$"Started on 150mg for a week, then 300mg for most of the 19 months since then. Paxil was my 1st poison, but the mental fog was too much for me. Tried Lexapro and Celexa for relapses, but.. didn't work. They just kept me 'comfortably numb' enough to get on with my life. Wellbutrin, on the other hand, contributed to a positive change in my outlook. I'm about to finish a graduate program for a professional degree I used to think was way beyond my capabilities. In addition to the degree, I'm in a fairly stable & supportive relationship (not the abusive, drunken ones of my youth), and have picked up 5K's as a recent hobby. Lost about 30 lbs within the 1st year. 
My major downfall is remembering to take my meds everyday at the same time. When I do forget, it takes about 48 hours for the creepy crawling feelings to start clouding my mind, and those are hard for me to shake off. About 4 months ago, I was struggling with my need to take antidepressants, and convinced myself that I could do just fine without any help from therapy + meds. Needless to say, I had a major meltdown within days that took 2 1/2 months of work to finally get ahead. 
Now, 5 weeks back on generic bupropion, I'm realizing the benefits I was afforded with this treatment - alert, focused, driven, confident - I felt more like the person I want to be, plus I have a healthy sex drive. Also, I never, ever want to go through withdrawal again, so I'm declining a recent Rx for Pristiq and all SSRI/SNRIs for as long as possible. I take 2 x 150mg pills everyday before 12pm, to take advantage of the elevated mood + energy boost and ability to really sleep afterwards. I still have my low moments, but I do recover with learned techniques & support."

I was taking (at first) 1-150mg AM,  I has relayed to my doctor that I really really needed to quit smoking, so he says ""ok!"", ""lets up your dose to 1-150mg AM and then 1-150 at noon. (For a few days, he says.) 4 or 5 days later, I went to 300mg AM and 150 at noon. I carried on (with life) as if nothing was happening. Then about 2 maybe 2 1/2 months into the 450mg daily, I woke up one day and started doing my 'honey do's (like always), but this time, i noticed it was almost noon and I hadn't lit a cigarette all day! Well dam, (i'm thinking) I haven't even wanted one all day. I didn't quit all at once. I went from a pack a day to 1/2 pack. THAT DAY. stayed with 1/2 pack  for about a week. Maybe.  From there, i went from 1/2pack 10 a day to 8 and then 7. From 7 to 5, then down to 4 a day. I kinda go stuck of 3 for a few more days than i thought I would but, i climbed the hill anyways and i was now at two a day. For a few days. And then 1. a day. For a few days. Then finally, I had one last cigarette in my car and i smoked it maybe 1/2 down,...and pitched it out the window.  From day one until I lit my last one was about 4 weeks.  But it wasn't the nicotine i was having to break myself from. The Wellbutrin had completely removed all urges and cravings for nicotine. The hardest part with stopping to smoke with Wellbutrin,was the 'breaking' of my old habits. I was well on my way of ridding myself of smoking, My only obstacle was ""what to do with my hands???"" For so long, if i  got on the phone, lite it up. ON the computer, lite it up. Driving down the road in my car,...lite it up. sitting on the front deck, watch the birds fly by,...lite it up! But after I got past all that 'easy' stuff, i was and AM on my way to a much healthier body. For my Grandchildren sake. It's been 5 months this past March 5th. I'm really, really proud of myself. "

If you are depressed with overeating, irritability, and excess sleepiness, try this. If you have a tendency to addictive behaviors, try this.
If you are anxious, can't sleep, have lost weight, or have high blood pressure - do not take this med. It will make things worse.

I now feel content and calm. I don't get agitated so easily or so stressed over kids, job or life. after 26 years of marriage our sex life is great. I've been loosing weight easily.I feel queasy if I eat a full meal. It's better to eat smaller portions more often. now I don't overeat. I do feel light headed a bit when I stand too quickly. I have more energy, feel more alert and wake up so much easier than I have my whole life.. I've never been a morning person. I had ""de ja vue"" seizures several years ago but this has not brought them back. I do have a harder time staying focused and feel a little ditzy or forgetful at times. all in all I really feel so much better and will stay on it even though mom is doing better because of the calmness and contentment and change in appetite I now have."

I am working full-time, but it is difficult due to the toll the depression and GAD has taken on my memory and concentration.  I'm taking 300 mg Wellbutrin, 100 mg Trazadone, and .05 Xanax as needed for anxiety/panic attacks.  I've tried almost every other anti-depressant - alone and in conjunction with Wellbutrin - and couldn't handle the side effects due to a medical disorder that I also have.  I thought Wellbutrin was a decent compromise - I still have bad days and crying spells, but I wasn't aware of any side effects.  HOWEVER... Wellbutrin's side effects crept up on me.  I have very, very thin hair now.  And in just the past two months I have a new side effect -- the inner tops of my ears have turned a dusky green/blue shade.  Anyone else with this side effect?  My doctor doesn't know what to make of it.  I attribute it to the Wellbutrin because my daughter also takes it, at the 450 mg level, and her ears started turning before mine did.  This is the only med we have in common.

Also, I take my Wellbutrin in one dosage first thing in the morning; Iknow this is not recommended, but it works for me. I have done this for 15.5 years without problems.

If I take it after 12noon it keeps me up at night.

I also breakout in a bad case of hives (hands, groin, feet) when I take KEFLEX while on Wellbutrin. This never happened with Keflex prior to getting on Wellbutrin...go figure.... obviously don't take Keflex anymore. I never could find any info on this interaction.

Are there any studies on the ramifications of really long-term usage?"

1017$Condition: Depression$8/27/2010 9:49:10 PM$Reviewer: anxiousgirl, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months$4$4$3$I have chronic anxiety and panic disorder, but do not normally feel depressed. For some reason docs always prescribe anti-depressents, which usually make me VERY depressed. I hate having to choose between panic attacks and morbid depression. Finally found that tiny amounts of lorazepam (.5mg) as needed help stop most panic attacks, but anxiety was still constant. Doc thought wellbutrin might help, since SSRI's etc. just kill me with depression. She thought since I seem compulsively anxious, and wellbutrin is sometimes prescribed for OCD, it was worth a try. First two weeks I felt much better, but eventually the dose at 150mg./day made me desperately depressed. But a month after I stopped, I was back to feeling out of my skin. So now the past 3 weeks I take 1/2 of a 75 mg. pill of buproprion twice per day, morning and mid-afternoon. I feel so much better! And I've already lost 3 pounds, don't feel either anxious or depressed, just basically calm. Can't tell you what a relief that is. I am thirsty and have some constipation, but those side-effects are worth it. I am very sensitive to medications, and this small dosing is working for me. For me, reducing dosage was the key.

I had more energy and focus as an added bonus.  I was able to quit for almost 2 years while on the drug.  I began smoking again after a year off the drug, so I recently began taking the generic version.  For the past 3 days, I have not been able to get to sleep for 4-5 hours after laying down.  I have no appetite and I cry at the drop of a hat.  I don't remember having any of these symptoms when I last used this medication.  I have read some of the comments and I am not the only one with these issues.  I keep taking it because I figure it's better than smoking. After 3 days on the meds, the thought of a smoke makes me nauseated.  I have lit up a few times out of sheer habit in the car and have not been able to finish one without gagging.

I experienced several side effects including not being able to sleep, irrational thoughts and behavior, paranoia and severe anxiety. I was experiencing a great deal of stress in my personal and professional life and thought that these symptoms were a result of the stress i was experiencing. It took me six weeks to realize that the medication was causing my anxiety and paranoia. I had several sleepless nights, and one day following one of these nights, i went to work and had an ""episode"" with my supervisor who thought I had gone crazy. I’m just hoping that my actions and behaviors won’t effect my position, probably a little late for that. I can say that the medication did seriously curb my desire to smoke, but I don’t feel that the benefits out-weighed the costs, I  would never recommend this drug to anyone for smoking cessation."

Adding this medication has given me the first sustained relief I have had from depression.  I have been diagnosed with long-term low level depression.  I have had some sleep disturbance and some joint aches.  They have varied in intensity and if the joint aches had not improved my doctor would probably have removed me from the medication.  But I would gladly lose a little sleep in order to finally know what it feels like to not be depressed.  It is wonderful and even great to be tired because of a little loss of sleep rather than just plain tired of life and dragging through my days.

Although I was seeing a psychiatrist I was drinking, smoking, gambling, mildly depressed and had constant mood swings. Within a month of taking this medicine all my addictions were gone. I just don't have the strong urges anymore and can rationalize and control my decisions. I don't look at food the same either sometimes I just don't eat at all (no hunger pains). The best thing about the medicine is that I have lost 20 pounds with exercise. The worse thing is that I have developed an addiction to sweets I didn't have before. All in all I am a better person when taking the drug even though a couple of times I have experienced a day of two of sadness but nowhere near like before. It has been seven months and I am much happier about my life. Wellbutrin is not for everyone and the side effects were very prominent for the first six weeks but went away.  Thank God for this medicine.

I was on it several years ago, with this outcome, but my doc decided to try again since I have little luch with oher types of meds. I took one dose over the weekend (half of a 75mg tab) and have a migraine again. I'm really sensitive to med side effects, so take this with a grain of salt, but I guess it's back to square one. I had the fewest side effects, and best results with Cymbalta, but it recently lost it's effectiveness.

About a year ago my doc added Wellbutrin to my regular Zoloft. I had been taking Zoloft for several years and I believe she started it to add to my energy, as it was low, and also to possibly help reduce my appetite. I had been trying for several years to lose weight and still had carb cravings and no weight loss. The first month I took it I lost 10 pounds, and since then have lost ten more. I did feel much more energetic (not manic, but normal)and became more active and was able to get more things done in my home and elsewhere.  Not only have I been treated for serotonin deficiency (for many years)last year I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder, which also causes fatigue. Wellbutrin has helped, but my dosage was just increased to the highest level, so I hope it remains effective as there is no where ""higher"" to go if my body becomes accustomed to this dosage and then the drug becomes less effective than before.

When I stopped taking medication a few times over the years to see what happened the bulemia urges came back very strongly even though nothing had changed emotionally for me. This has led me to believe very strongly that bulemia is much more of a physical illness than a mental one. It has helped me more with depression than any other medication.

I had my first husband, my brother and my dad die within 3 years. Also a SPED teacher, stress and severe DDD of the lower back.  I have had 3 major back operations.  The XL has helped me not cry on the spur of the moment. I have had no ballistic moments with daughter or students. 

I have been able to get thru the day, althought it has given me a ""I don't give a sh*t"" mood at times, it is bettr than high anxiety, stress and muscle pain in the back.

I am now retired 6/08 due to the back and stress (30 years of SPED) is enough. I still am not lowering my daily dose right now. I am going thru menopause (just great) and have a new husband.

I am also taking Cymbalta 20 at night but I want to get off of that due to weight gain.

My family hid it from me that depression ran in the family. I was I had something sooner then maybe my life would have been not as stressful and muscle bound.

Cryed at the littlest of things and would go off over stupid things.  I think my husband thinks I have turned into a crazy woman and he doesn't know why.  Additionally I do not sleep well.

There's a couple side effects I don't like though. Under normal day-to-day activities I don't feel any dizziness, I'm a ballet dancer, and I've noticed that chaine turns and pique turns (basically spinning really fast across the floor) are markedly a lot more difficult, and sometimes I have to sit down in class because the dizziness is overwhelming. This of course is extremely frustrating, I'm one of the strongest dancers in my group, but this is holding me back. I also have a ringing in my ears. I take 150mg twice a day, and I don't like monitering the time so closely to be sure I take them on time. But at least for now, I feel much better than I did before, so I'm not ready to give up on it yet.
1053$Condition: Depression$5/22/2010 10:28:56 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$4$3$Wellbutrin has been very effective for me in that it gives me a boost of energy, easier to get out of bed in the morning, and my social anxiety is a whole lot easier to deal with. I started taking it because my best friend died recently and I was having the most difficult time in the world getting the most basic things done, I never wanted to go out in public, it was extremely painful to do homework and go to class, etc. I've always been a bit prone to depression anyway, but this is the worst it's ever been. I used to take Zoloft, but I didn't like it for 2 reasons, firstly, it took away my sex drive, and secondly, it made me permanently in a good mood, I lost my natural range of emotion. Wellbutrin hasn't done that for me at all, I feel much more like myself, it's still possible to have a bad day and I'm ok with that, I think it's healthy. Of course I'm still grieving my friend very much, it happened only 3 months ago, so I still cry almost everyday, but now it's just for a few minutes and it doesn't completely engulf me. As for the sex drive, oh god, it's increased exponentially, sometimes I need to have sex several times a day or I go a little bit crazy, it's my boyfriend's dream come true. If I wasn't in a relationship it would be a very bad thing!! There's a couple unfortunate side effects: I've lost weight, for most people this is a much desired side effect, but I was already in perfect shape and didn't need to lose any weight. Also, I can't get to sleep at night, so my doctor also prescribed Ambien, which works just fine. The most annoying side effect is the constant ringing in my ears, most the time I can forget and not notice it, but when I do it kind of drives me crazy. And the final side effect is occasional constipation, which is always horrible for anyone. Before I go to bed I drink senna leaf tea, and that works very well, it's pretty powerful stuff.

HOWEVER, there are differences within the generic brand (Bupropion). I recently switched drug stores where my prescription is filled and received a different ""type"" of the same drug. Before I was taking 300XL of an oval-shaped white pill. The ones I just received are 300XL but round white pills. And I feel a distinct difference. 

In fact, I feel like I'm going through the initial first stages of taking the drug all over again (dry mouth, restlessness, jitters). I understand that different companies make the generics but I cannot find a site that states which company has better quality products.  

Overall, Wellbutrin is, IMO, one of the better anti-depressants out there. "

The birth control killed my sex drive, made me gain 30 pounds (I was tall and thin before), ruined my sleeping habits,  made me extra moody, and caused a lot of anxiety.  I felt like I couldn't think clearly any more and I couldn't reason as well - things just weren't connecting in my head.  I didn't want to go off the birth control because of awful cramps so my doctor started me on this drug.  The first few days I felt nauseous and my head felt like it was in a vice.  Within a few days I was feeling fine.  I can think clearly, my sleep has got better, I've gained a little of my sex drive back, and I lost some of the weight I had gained because of the birth control.  I am finally feeling more like myself.  I haven't really had any side affects except increased sensitivity to light.  I am very satisfied with it.

Then my bp was 136/100, which is extremely high, as i usually run at 120/80. My arm went completely numb as if it were asleep, and it felt like pins and needles in my hand. My heart beat was also showing arythmia.
  I felt like I was ready to crawl out of my skin, cause of this overwhelming panic feeling. I ended up vomiting 4 times in a period of 30 mins. It was the most terrible feeling in the world, and I seriously thought I was going to die of a stroke. I have been ordered to completely stop taking this med.

Initially it took my appetite but it has returned. I don't overeat like I used to though. I'm usually a very regular person but cant go daily like I used to. Dr. said I may not as long as I take the meds.  I have some mild ringing in my ears. It's gotten better. 1st couple of weeks I had trembling hands but it too has subsided.  I no longer have the crazy dreams and am now able to sleep through the night. If I consume too much alcohol I get the worse headache.  Overall my depression IS better.   I no longer sleep all day and am able to think a lot clearer. My creativity has returned!! Oh, also no sexual side effects.

I have fought depression for 25 years.  It worsened with pregnancy and marriage to a very narcisstic partner.  I have taken many combinations of SSRIs most have been ineffective until I added Welbutrin.  I have found the generic versions to be much less effective and have had to switch to the Welbutrin SR and XL versions over time in order to continue with the brand name drug.  Overall, Welbutrin has kept me out of bed and functioning because it keeps the mental fog at bay and gives me much needed energy.  The Lexapro augments my symptoms be keeping the suicidal thoughts away and reduces my anxiety.  So, overall Welbutrin has helped me to keep functioning despite a very depressing marriage.  My new insurance will not allow me to continue my current dosages and I am afraid that things will slip back.  Does anyone have suggestions as to handle the insurance limitations?

I have to go off of it because I can not take the side effects. Dry mouth, tremors, anxiety attacks and the worst headache of my life that has not gone away in 5 days. I can not even open my right eye for more than a few seconds because the pain is so intense.

I was taking 150mg for the first week and then the second week I went up to 150 mg twice a day. My skin started to crawl, I turned mean as a snake and yelled at everyone. Forget sleeping. I have had none in over a week. All I do is lay in bed and pray that this intense pounding in my head will go away.

I know some people think that you need to give it more time, but before I was taking this I was just a bit down feeling. Now I am both depressed and anxious and in constant pain and I can't even leave my house.

So my experience with this drug has not been a good one at all. Now I am worrying about any repercussions I may have coming off of it. Hopefully, since I was not on it but a few weeks the withdrawal will not be too bad.

If you suffer from any type of anxiety disorder I would strongly suggest that you do NOT take this medication. "

1115$Condition: Depression$1/14/2010 9:59:35 PM$Reviewer: xbabyx, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$4$I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression when I was 14. I tried various medications with little success and many negative side-effects (weight-gain, fatigue, loss of interest/listlessness, etc). For several years i tried to handle my symptoms on my own, and I tauhgt myself how to handle my anxiety attacks but the depression and general anxiety weren't improving. Shortly before I turned 18 I began cognitive behavioral therapy once a week, and a drug regimine to control my symptoms. She prescribed a few different medications along the way to try to find one that worked for me, and one of the trials was Wellbutrin. My mother had taken it with good results, so I consented. After about 3 days I was forced to stop taking the pills - my depression and anxiety had gone from distracting but not over-whelming to literally life-threatening in 72 hours. I began self-mutilating (a habit I had managed to break myself of during my pill-less years) and became incredibly paranoid, agitated, angry, depressed, and I isolated myself from everyone and everything. Again, all within 72 hours! I am not saying this medication is horrible and should never be used by anyone, I just want to share my story so everyone knows that yes it can work (like for my mother), but it might not and might actually be dangerous (like it was for me). So always be sure to discuss any concerns you have with your doctor, beginning or continuing a medication is a big decision and it could have serious effects on your health and your life both positive or negative. Be careful, and good luck!

I have also been diagnosed with ADHD and Bipolar Disorder so I thought that this might be something to try. well after takeing it for about a week I had a severe allergic reaction. I personally caution all of you that are considering taking this drug for something like quitting smokeing please talk with your doctor about some of the severe side affects to this drug. For me it went well for the first week until i started feeling anxious and a feeling of impending doom. Next came the chest pain and pounding heart. The next day I awoke to find my hands and feet swollen to the point i couldn't wear my gloves or boots. I also had a rash over my entire body and hives. I have stopped taking the medication but 5 days later I am still having trouble breathing a rash and hives. I have been forced to take large doses of several drugs in order to try to combat this reaction to include Epenephrine Benedryl and Prednisone. To let you all know i was the guy that never worried about side affects. I work in the medical field and i was able to monitor my condition and take the right steps in order to treat my condition. If you have any of these side affects don't do like i did go to the ER IMMEDIATELY these are symptoms of what can be a deadly allergic reaction. but pleas don't blow off you doctor when he tells you about side affects listen to them. I will say this though I quit smoking and it works well for that and i felt great most of the time i was on it.

I was prescribed for depression/A.D.D. I am discontinuing use of it this week. First off I had a horrific first month: brutal nightmares, severe irritability, nausea, short fused, angry enough to kill with my bare hands. Month 2 showed a dramatic improvement: instant energy upon intake, loss of appetite, increased interest in work/learning/hobbies.. However, I had even more social anxiety and my ""ocd"" tendencies were at an all time high. Month 3 has been an utter disapointment. I no longer feel rejuvenated upon intake. In fact i'm pretty lethargic for the most part.  I have ideas for personal entertainment but instead lay motionless on my couch or in my bed. I'm so sick of wasting time.....Two thumbs down !"

The first day, I got the jitters, like when you've had too much coffee, that lasted a couple of hours, then I never had them again. It also has made me slightly nauseous, which increases with dosage increase. I'm currently taking half of a 75mg pill, because taking a whole one made extremely nauseous. Now, after a month on a half, the nausea is almost completely gone. It also does control my appetite. I eat way less and my usual ""grazing"" doesn't happen anymore. yay!

After about 2 weeks on the med the fog lifted from my head and once again I feel joy.  Though I do experience a slight dry mouth side effect, I am also experiencing a decrease in appetite which is actually a benefit as I have always had to closely watch my calories in order to maintain my slender figure.  I plan on remaining on the drug until springtime (I live in the PacNW and the nonstop winter rain is enought to make anyone depressed!) and will slowly wean myself off.

It's been 10-years since my last smoke. I still use Wellbutrin 150mgx2, which seems like a pretty light dose. Still, if I don't take it I feel many of the symptoms reported on this blog. Times are getting tougher for me now (and the rest of the world too) and I'm thinking 150mg may need to be increased. I hope I can cope with dosage and not by changing to another drug...this one really works for me.   In fact, I think if I had something like Wellbutrin when I was (much) younger, I would have had fewer problems. I've only found one thing better than Wellbutrin....membership in a gym.

No-it wasn't. ALL of the old symptoms re-appeared. If they could only find a way to make the effects of this drug last, SO many people with the same problems could be helped. I should add that I also had (still do)chronic fatigue(it's a.d.d.-NOT a.d.h.d.)chronic pain & fibro. Wellbutrin was amazing!

People: take the medication exactly as prescribed. If the side effects are too strong, tell the dr., but just because you get certain side effects at certain dosages, doesn't mean it doesn't work. This has been great for me! I was taking prozac before for YEARS. I have been taking Wellbutrin now for about 1-1/2 years. Don't review it if it's been 2 days or 2 weeks!! I've never known an anti-depressant that works that soon. Obviously, the major things you should report to your dr and maybe the dose needs to be decreased. I know, been there, done that. This decreased my apetite (I gained with prozac) and improved the sex drive (great for my marriage). I felt mental clarity and I felt like ""me"" which I hadn't felt in years. One of my first reactions was, ""Man! I missed myself."" I have so much more energy (which as you know with depression is horrible). My dr initially recommended that I work my way up to 4 a day (2 am, 2pm), but that was too much and I felt some of the things others have described (suicidal thoughts-never felt that before this). I didn't like the two doses a day. I'm only taking one and it's okay. My drs told me what symptoms I may feel and were great about following up. Yes dry mouth and funny taste, but I didn't jet the ""jitteriness"" that they said I might. Do a ""google"" search for it, there's a website where people review this after more than 2 days of taking it...lol :)"

1192$Condition: Depression$9/4/2009 3:02:29 PM$Reviewer: Grateful1, 25-34 Female  (Patient) $4$5$5$In the past several months I went from nothing to several drugs. I went from not eating and losing 45lbs in 2 months to taking Pristiq which made me want to jump out of a window and was causing me to wake with extremely bad anxiety attacks(once I finally fell asleep), hyperventilate and miss work.I tried that for 2 weeks and couldn't stand it any longer. Then I was prescribed Lexapro, which after the 1st night made me feel the same way as the  Pristiq and I immediately stopped that next day. My doctor was so perplexed and gave me 150mg of Wellbutrin. I was nervous at 1st but then I made it thru 2 weeks and was feeling GREAT! My mood changed and I was actually sleeping like I haven't in YEARS!I'm now doing 300mg and can really see a difference. I think I am going to stick with this until otherwise proven different.It's all about what you can tolerate. But I've learned that if a drug like these make u feel worse... as soon as u realize it...STOP IMMEDIATELY and CALL SOMEONE WHO'S AWARE OF YOUR SITUATION!
1193$Condition: Other$9/3/2009 4:16:38 PM$Reviewer: Lucia, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$5$5$"A year ago, I decided there were several areas of my life that needed to be ""cleaned up"". One of those areas was starting Wellbutrin for ADD and mild depression. My angel of a marriage counselor suggested I look into it. The side effects I experienced were dry mouth and a little trouble sleeping. I have also lost about 10 lbs which may not be a good thing since I was already very thin. I very rarely feel hungry. Wellbutrin has worked great for the ADD. It is very subtle but I just feel so much more competent and on top of things. I used to forget something important on a daily basis. I am no longer depressed, but it's hard to say whether it's the meds or the life changes. I wasn't sure if I was depressed until I started taking this drug. Now I know I was. I am really glad my Dr gave me this instead of a more comman ADD med. Again, it could be the life changes, but I just feel very ""at home"" in my life."

1196$Condition: Depression$8/23/2009 7:10:28 PM$Reviewer: scribs, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$3$5$This is my 3rd day taking the generic, 100mg SR. I was stoked at first to have no side effects, but last night, I noticed what I thought was some dry mouth and when I was trying to sleep, my restless leg syndrome (which is mild) was worse, and I felt sort of like I had a mild electric current running thru my entire body. Today, the dry mouth is definitely there (bummer), and I seem to be developing a slight tremor. Also feel slightly nauseated and am having anxiety issues.  I get headaches a lot, so it's hard to tell if the headache I've got today is from the drug or just me. If this is as bad as it gets, I'll keep taking it, but the seizure thing is making me nervous, what with the feeling of an electric current running through me. I'm gonna tough it out and see if it gets better; I realize there's a period of adjustment, and I really want this drug to work, since it doesn't cause problems with weight & sex drive.  I am perimenopausal, and it might be making the hot flashes worse, though. That SUCKS.

My Dr. would like to up this dosage to 450, however I'm not comfortable with this dosage - have tried this higher does for a few days and could not handle it. With the 300 mg/ first few weeks my fingers twitched but this passed. My sex drive has improved , started going to yoga and pilates classes on a reg. bases. Stopped sneaking back to bed after dropping the kids off at school and smile more. Infact I sleep less and feel okay. Need to eat prior to taking and if I take the medication in the afternoon sleep is difficult that night. Have tried paxol - 3yrs ago for postpardom depression- symptoms - fell asleep while sitting up on the couch, that's more than just tired and lost my sex drive completely. Different people metabolize medication differently. My Dr. now wants to add Lexapro to the mix - not to sure about this which is why I'm doing my research. Also was prescribed clonazepam, however I have only taken three pills in the three months and only a half pill each time. They make me feel high; a little to good.

Once I started to feel like it wasn't working for me so my MD told me to take 200mg twice a day; but found it to cause dizziness and  a feeling like I was going to pass out, had difficulty driving.  So I cut back to 100mg bid, and those sx immediately went away.  Funny thing was, though, my MD didn't think the Wellbutrin had anything to do with it; but I had just increased the dosage about 2 weeks prior and it went away immediately when I cut back.  I made sure my MD knew this.  Then after talking to a friend, I tried 200mg at bedtime.    This works best for me. I even lost 20 lbs. I would recommend it; just make sure you are advocating for you.  If you don't agree with your dr, tell them!!

However, I was eventually prescribed 300mg bid and ended up having a grand mal seizure (1st seizure) at work.  This medication's seizure threshold lowering properties likely had a role in inducing this seizure, so I am no longer taking it.  It does significantly increase sex drive (which can lead to poor decisions by some...), but this wasn't too much of an issue for me.  Great medication, except for the seizure.

If I'm an hour or so late on one of my doses, I get a little cranky, but it goes away shortly after I take my dose.  I also have noticed that I don't sleep as long.

In the past, I have been on Prozac and Paxil. Wellbutrin (incl. generics) has vastly exceeded the other drugs in effectivness for me. Tho there were side effects at one time, off and on for awhile, including some mild agitation and slight anxiety, and moderate or substantial agitation and irritation at higher dosages, they have gone away almost 100%. Currently, after re-engaging at the higher dose (150 mg SR 2x a day, previously was on 150mg SR 1x/day) I have had almost no side effects, certainly none that are substantially disturbing. And for probably the first time in 40 years I find my depressive symptoms dramatically reduced, well below what I had previously thought of as 'normal' or 'complete symptom elimination.' I now feel that I was not aware of what normal is. For me, I believe my body needed some time to acclimate to the drug. However I am so happy with current status I wished I had tried the higher dose again sooner.

After 20 years of experimenting with SSRIs, I have an almost ideal combo of Wellbutrin XL (generic) 150 mg each morning PLUS Lexapro 10 mg each night. Wellbutrin made me hyper at first, so I lowered the dosage. It has no negative sexual side effects, so it balances Lexapro nicely (in fact, it has the opposite effect). No weight gain, late-night munchies, sleeping all the time. It's truly different from all the rest. Effexor was awful, Paxil made me fat, Zoloft made me sleepy, Prozac made me nuts, and none of those helped my depression. Wellbutrin saved me, and its generics are so much cheaper than the alternatives. If you're not doing well with the standard Rx, try this...it's truly different, and ask your doc about combining meds.

The side effects i've had is dry mouth, sore throat, and a weird taste in the morning and late at night.  I have also had insomnia but i suffered from that long before and my doctor has prescribed me a sleeping pill that works hand in hand with wellbutrin.  I have noticed that i have been feeling a little more jittery today since i have increased it but i will moniter and see if my amount is too much.  I believe that this will go away after a while though.  lastly i just wanted to add that i ate my feeling when i was depressed and while i am not horribly overweight i am a little and that was one of my biggest reasons for being depressed.  and slowly i am noticing my appitite and cravings going down and i think i am losing a little weight.  thank god!  but i recommend doing your homework and not settling but finding the right drug for you. before i took lexapro and it killed my sex life and i took cymbalta and it made me very dizzy and nauscious.  so i have finally found something that works FOR ME.

Didn't know people could ever feel this good, or be this focused & clear-minded.  DX over the past decade with PMDD, ADHD, Depression & SADD.  Also have Hashimoto's, and arthritis causing chronic pain & disturbed sleep.  

On Wellbutrin, I didn't implode from stress over the holidays, I'm not dwelling on things or blowing them out of proportion, anxiety is down, and my self-attitude is more positive.  I feel far more connected to people & interested in things, and I'm not procrastinating so much.

The combo of careful monitoring & tweaking my thyroid hormones, a daily progestin-only mini-pill to counter-balance high estrogen levels, a using a SADD lite box a few times a week, plus Wellbutrin, seems to be the answer for me.
  
I started on Wellbutrin @75 mg daily for 4 weeks, moved to 100 mg of XL daily 2 weeks ago.  Only side effect is getting a bit overheated while sleeping.  Normally I wear sweats, a nite cap & blanket set on High, so this is a good thing.  

Tried SSRIs - Zoloft, Prozac & Lexapro, plus Atenolol for anxiety/stress symproms, & Strattera for ADHD, but cardiovascular side effects were extreme, or left me feeling ""flat"" and apathetic, and had a major allergic reaction to Strattera."

1307$Condition: Stop Smoking$1/2/2009 12:02:30 AM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $2$1$4$I have bipolar and anxiety, and I smoke. My MD prescribed Wellbutrin last week at my request to help me quit smoking. Since taking Wellbutrin for about a week, it has overridden my anti-anxiety medication. I have experienced pounding heart-beat, agitation, frequent urination, inability to concentrate, and change in mood(irritable hypo-mania of my bipolar). I am calling my doctor in the morning to discuss these negative side-effects with him, and am quitting taking this Wellbutrin. I will try other methods of quitting smoking. The reason I asked for Wellbutrin is because when a person has a mood disorder like bipolar or depression, quitting smoking cold-turkey can cause severe depression and crying-spells. Just a note: this is my own personal experience with Wellbutrin. If you have an anxiety disorder and you want to quit smoking, please discuss with your MD the side-effects I have experienced. Please note that everyone reacts to meds differently, so this review I am giving is just an FYI.
1308$Condition: Depression$1/1/2009 3:26:42 PM$Reviewer:  Female  (Patient) $2$1$3$I've been on Bupropion for about three weeks now. The good effect I've had so far is a clarity in dealing with depressive thoughts and the appearance of optimistic thoughts- it has given me moreso the capacity to choose among them. The side effects, though, are infuriating. I feel constantly in a haze, dizzy, and less aware. My vision is a little blurred. I have mild headaches, but not near as bad as ones I got from SSRIs (prozac, lexapro, celexa). I feel somewhat nauseous. Reading takes a little more effort and I'm having a hard time spelling, which is really strange- not being able to pull the words forward, maybe because I have blurry vision and feel hazed over. Do the side effects normally go away with time? I hope so. I want badly for this drug to work.

I really didn't want to think I had something I couldn't take care of myself.  I started taking a low dosage of Wellbutrin (actually the generic) once a day about 2 months ago and it has worked very well for me.  The first couple of weeks I felt a little dazed and loopy and I have mild headaches every now and then but those seem to be the only side effects.  I actually lost a little weight when I started but now have come to a stand still in the weight area.  My overall mood has benefited greatly and I find myself enjoying life more and I take things in stride much better. My Dr. has suggested that I only stay on it for a few more months and then go off it which I think I will try as I hate being on a medication every day.  I do think I'll wait until Spring as I live in Upstate New York and our winters always depress me!  I found this sight because I'm looking for a cold medicine with a decongestant that I can take with Wellbutrin.  I don't like having to worry about drug interactions when I just want to take a simple cold tablet.  I would recommend this medicine to anybody that is looking for some releif from depression.

I was switched off of Paxil and Zoloft after SERIOUS weight gain was making me depressed (LOL).  Anyway, I take it for anxiety/OCD.  I am extremely satisfied with the effects of this drug.  I have none of the side effects that people mention.  To be honest, I have none of the side effects at ALL.  The only thing that I notice about this medication verses the others is that I have a little more energy, I don't feel like I am in a fog, and I have lost 4 pounds!  I am certainly not going to complain over THOSE side effects.  I can see where some people feel that they can't sleep.  With that in mind, I started taking my medication FIRST THING IN THE MORNING!  By evening, I have no problem sleeping at all.
My biggest word of advise to everyone is to remember that statistically, when people are complaining about something, they tell 10 people, but when they are satisfied with something, they tell one or two.  Don't allow the reviews to deter you from trying this medication, or any other medication that may help you live a normal life.  Try...and try again...until you find the one that works for you.  Wellbutrin is certainly the one that works for me.  I wish you the best of health!"

It was the one and only anti-depressant I was even willing to try based on the possible side-effects. Thankfully, it worked for me because I know many people have to try several different types of meds before they find the right one (or combination) that will work for them. I do recall that it took about six weeks for many of the initial side effects to go away; tingling sensation, bad taste in mouth, mild nausea, insomnia, etc. At the time, I was severely depressed/suicidal and suffered from PTSD as well. The initial bothersome side effects were minor compared to my critical emotional state, so I didn't focus on them too much. I'm glad for that now, because I could've easily decided that the drug wasn't working and found myself getting on the medication roller coaster that many people suffer through. I wouldn't be here if I hadn't taken this drug. The other thing that helped is that I didn't rely on medication alone. At my worst, I was seeing a counselor 2-3 times per week. Eventually, I was able to go on a very light dose (100mg 1xday), just as a preventative measure. That was 6 years ago. No recurrence of depression and I couldn't identify any side effects that are problematic if I tried. Severe, chronic depression runs in my familly and my first onset of this level of clinical depression was when I was just 9 years old, (I'm 45 now). One of my brothers was even younger. The only family members that are not struggling with severe depression are the ones that are on Wellbutrin. One family member changed meds (from Well to many others) because he couldn't deal with the insomnia and he spent the next 4 years spiraling down to the pits of hell. He went back on it 6 months ago and he's doing well. Yeah, I'm a big fan of Wellbutrin and a fortunate one at that. Good luck to those of you just embarking on recovery. My heart really goes out to you.

For the first two days it did help with the depression, but by day 3 I was totally wired: jittery, super anxious, unable to eat or sleep, felt like electricity was flowing to my finger tips, etc. I stopped and took an anti-anxiety med for a couple of days, just to be able to relax and sleep. Then switched to regular Wellbutrin: 100 mg in the morning and 50 mg in the afternoon. I think it does help with the depression but I still have ups and downs all the time. Overall feeling less gloomy and hopeless. However, it completely killed my appetite. I am never hungry. I try to eat more or less regularly, but have lost weight. The other side effect is almost constant, low grade nausea. My doc suggested increasing to 200 mg/day, but that just made the nausea worse. For now, I will stick with 150 mg/day. I also continue to take an anti-anxiety med (Clonazopan) at bedtime. I don't get more that 4 or 5 hours of sleep, but at least when I do wake up at 5 am, I feel calm and sometimes can even go back to sleep for a bit. I feel a bit tired during the day, but am not sure if it is because of lack of sleep or the Wellbutrin.

I have only been on it for about a month, and I am already seeing results. HOWEVER, this drug is making me lose my hair. Im a female by the way, and in most people's opinions losing your hair is worse when youre a woman. My hair started to thin at the top of my head. My whole life I have had very thick hair. My hair is completely thin now. I have a bald spot at the top of my hair. Im on the younger side for taking this drug, and i feel that by staying on this I will lose more and more.

Also, if you have any manic state of mind consult your doctor and read the package  info.  Tapering off of it is important if you want to stop it and a very gradual build-up is important if you are starting it.  This helps avoid headache.

Wellbutrin makes me feel like the fog has lifted.  I start to feel so good, in fact, that I'll stop taking it, but I always crash 6-18 months later.  I hate being on any antidepressant, but this one (150mg 2x daily) has worked best for me.  Side effects (sleeplessness, dry mouth, decreased appetite, a general speedy feeling) have always been mild and and have worked themselves out in a couple of weeks.  Always drop a few pounds, too.

I have recently went to the doctor about quitting smoking. I have been on the generic wellbutrin for a day and a half now. So far I have been smoke free that whole time. I don't think I would have done it without the help of this pill. I have felt a bit in a daze, but nothing too bad, It didnt effect my ability to drive. I have felt happier too.

I started this drug a month ago for anxiety and anger issues rolled into a little depression. The first week was heaven! I had more energy than I've had in a long time. As a matter of fact, I couldn't stop talking and was talking really fast as if my brain couldn't keep up with my mouth. I mean it was to the point where my mother thought I had been drinking because I am not usually much of a talker. Then the side effects got worse. I couldn't sleep and went 4 nights straight without sleeping. Benadryl, Tylenol PMC and Sominex didn't help. Finally called my MD and got a prescription for some Lunesta to help me sleep. On top of that, my hands shake like crazy and people are always asking me if I'm nervous, had dry mouth, headaches, slight nausea and the WORST of it is the acne. My face, chest, neck and back are broken out worse than it ever was when I was a teen (I'm 31.)

So my doctor had me titrate down on the Zoloft from 150mg to 50mg and add Wellbutrin, 150mg twice a day. Starte at just one dose (150mg) in the morning with no bad physical symptoms, although emotionally I was going through hell. Ever since bumping up to the second dose of 150mg, I have constant shortness of breath. Mood is a little better, but not enough to justify this shortness of breath. Also constantly yawning, sleeping poorly (waking up too many times, extremely vivid dreams, waking up too early). Going to talk to my doctor about it. I've read that this drug works better with people who only have depression. Never knew I was overly anxious before Wellbutrin, but beginning to think it is causing me to be so.

It made me live for today, feel beautiful as I am and not care about other's judgements, including my own of myself and other people.

I was put on Lexapro, and have been at a dosage of 20mg for the last 5 months.  I've felt pretty great on Lexapro, and took Clonozepam for about a month and a half to get over my panic disorder.  Over these past six months, I have had very little trouble with panic, nothing more than low level anxiety, which was easily knocked out with a Clonozepam.  Zero panic attacks though (after having them about 20 times a day).  About two weeks ago, I began to feel ""down"" again, as school came to a close, and life was about to change.  I consulted my doctor, and he placed me on Welbutrin.  150mg for a week, and then up to 300mg.  I started taking this 9 days ago, and have had more issues with anxiety and panic in those few days than in the last 6 months.  This medication should NOT be given to patients with panic/anxiety issues.  I'm calling my psychiatrist tomorrow and getting off of this stuff."

I was DESPERATE to keep my marriage intact and to be a better mother. I walked around sad all the time with no desire or motivation for no reason at all. I also seemed angry all the time. 
At first, I was a little nauseus and a tiny bit dizzy, but the thing that I noticed most was that I was restless at night and my mind RACED and I could NOT shut it down! I didn't sleep much the 1st few nights so the pharamcist reduced my dosage to 150mg per day instead of 300mg (SR, not XL) and I could sleep again, felt less dizzy and less nauseus as the days went by until eventually I felt normal except for the dry mouth that I have 24/7.
 Recently I noticed after 2 months that it seemed to wane just a little and I felt some anxiety again. I asked the pharmacist about increasing my dosage. He put me on 200 mg per day about 3 days ago and WHAM! The nuaseusness hit full force today and I threw up and felt so dizzy that the room continued to spin and I could not function. I have been drinking a lot of water to flush it out of my system and I feel better now. He is now going to let me try 200mg per day in 2 doses 12 hours apart instead of just one big 200 mg dose all at one time.(I weigh less than 120 lbs so it was a bit much for me) Be patient, if you are taking it for less than a month, stay with it for a little longer, the side effects went away for me. 
My family members do not know that I am trying this. I noticed that I am much more relaxed and less obsessive about stupid little things and I think more clearly, have more energy, and am a bit more patient with my kids. It helped me to realize how today is important and to enjoy what I have now because  life is too short! I still feel anxious at times, but not like I used to be! Also, I am not so negative all the time and critical about others. 
I hope that it continues to work for me!
I wrote a lot in hopes of helping others.

Also, because I am a smoker. It has helped my moods tremendously. I still get a little moody around the time of my period, but not nearly as bad as before. Although, I was not prescribed wellbutrin for smoking, it has also helped with cravings. I still like to smoke, but I do not smoke as much and I never crave a cigarette. Overall, I am very happy with wellbutrin. I do not feel as stressed as I used to be and I have a lot less anxiety than before. The only annoying side effect is dry mouth.

Taking Wellbutrin together with Imipramine, the Wellbutrin has some kind of a reaction that does not allow the Liver to properly metabolize the Imipramine.  This happend to me.  I presented with all kinds of Neurological symptoms, but actually had VERY HIGH BLOOD LEVELS of imipramine even though my dosage had remained unchanged for over a year.  There is some actual medical research available to back this up, however, until recently this has not been a problem because these two drugs are not often prescribed together.

Mostly inattentive. Jittery for about 4 months. It buys me that extra second I need to keep from putting my foot in my mouth. 
  I wanted to try this as I detest the crash of the mainline ADD drugs. DR. also tells me there should be less of the dosage creep of adderal, etc.
  On 300 MG and happy as a clam. It also cured my cold sleeping. Went from 5"" of covers in July (GA) to sheet and single blanket. A very unexpected bonus and worth the price of admission alone.
  It does not do a lot for racing thoughts. It seems to give me the patience to put up with them. It does allow me to stop and remember where I put things. As a result, I can function much better out in my shop. (Less time looking for tools.) As a teacher it helps me handle the paperwork. 
  It won't solve all the ADD issues, but it is buying me time to ge back on track. ADD diagnosed age 8, 53 now. No drugs for last 32 years. Only script I take. Death of wife/ADD Coach knocked me out of sync. I am quite happy with things for now."

So far I do notice a loss of appetite, and nice as that is, I have to make sure at the end of each day that i have had enough to eat. This may have to do with taking concerta which also lowers appetite. I really don't feel jittery or anything. It defainetly gets my oversleeping under control and is great so far. I got sick during this time so it  is possible that some symptoms i had were related or lexapro withdrawal. These were headache, loss of consciousness (but i have low blood pressure), nausea, and ears popping. I don't know much else yet but so far it is working. It also has made me not need to smoke (which is great because i really shouldn't). It could be depression but i also feel like i am either over or under emotional. Don't know but it is better than oversleeping. I would take pretty much anything over that.

Meaning does my body just have to get used to the new pill?  I have noticed a slight decrease in appetite which I love!  Other than the few symptoms I listed above it's great.  Can anyone give me some advice on what to do?  Do I keep taking Wellbutrin for my system to adjust to it or go back to the Lexapro.  Any suggestions would be great!!

1453$Condition: Depression$12/9/2007 8:20:06 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$4$I have struggled with depression my whole life and I am not 34. I have been one-and-off meds since 2000. In April 2007 I went back on the meds again. This time it was Zoloft, which made me feel terrific when it kicked in, but I gradually needed more and more until I (at 110 lbs) was at the maximum dosage of 200mg generic Zoloft (sertraline) by September 2007. So my psychiatrist added Wellbutrin, which seemed to help. Honestly, as someone who actually works as a license adolescent therapist and has a lot of experience with my own and treating depression.... the cycle never ends. You spend your whole life switching meds, gradually going off the meds, changing meds, and starting meds over. The best thing you can do is read a lot of books about depression and figure out what contributes to your depression. For me, I grew up with an alcoholic parents and basically walked on egg shells. You never knew if you'd be yanked out of bed by your hair in the middle of the night to wash dishes, you could never have a friend over and no matter what you did it was wrong. Research shows this actually interferes with your brain development and contributes to depression. Today, I have a busy career and I have to monitor how much I take on or I get angry and obsessive along with the depression. I can also say you need to marry someone who understands depression and is NOT depressed themselves. The spouse needs to be supportive and you need to have rules. One of our rules is that my husband will never walk away from me (because it sends me into a depressive rage). My husband also realizes that sometimes I say mean and nasty things to him that I would never say if I weren't having a depressive angry moment. It's hard. We have a toddler and my husband is an at home dad. We love our daughter and want her to have a parents at home, but it can't be me with my depression. My husband being at home help lessen my depression because it's less home-management for me. [email protected]

Before I started Bupropion, I had had five depressive episodes in four years; I have not had a depressive episode since I began taking Bupropion four years ago. I can feel happy again and I can laugh. I am able to feel sadness, but it doesn't overwhelm me. I am not drowning in self-loathing anymore. I am myself again and I have been myself for four years. As far as negative side-effects are concerned, I will have a migraine if I accidentally skipped a dose the day before. It also took a while to kick in. The first two weeks were difficult because my brain would go ""offline"" in the afternoon and I wouldn't be able to do anything until my brain ""restarted"" later in the evening. This pattern lasted for a few weeks. The first month was pretty terrible, though there were glimmers that things were changing; I would feel less awful than usual for ten minutes every few days. The second month was a little better; I was able to feel happy for an entire hour one day and could generally enjoy things more. Week nine was when I had five whole good days where I could feel happy any time I wanted all day long. Week ten was when everything took off and I started feeling like myself again. Four years later, this medication still works for me. I have been able to get back on my feet and rebuild my life after my depression because the chemicals in my brain are working for me and not against me. I feel good. I can feel good whenever I want. I'm not held captive by depression anymore. Bupropion made all of that possible."

Being a non-smoker has saved my health, and literally over $20,000. I'm grateful."

The depression feeds into my anxiety.  I am a low starting dose.  I am concerned about my blood pressure, but it hasn't noticably risen.  Part of my issue may have been working remotely with little to no human interaction whilst my better half goes to work.  That said, I am not as anxious these days.  I even started traveling for business again and it is painless!  I feel the need to exercise somewhat regularly again!  I sweated two days in a row and actually jogged on the treadmill! I can't say that I have lost any appreciable weight, but I feel ""lighter"" in mood and actually want to do things.  I may have incorrectly attributed my depression to being an introvert and vice versa.  I do really like people even thought they (except for really good friends) drain my energy reserves."

1520$Condition: Depression$2/7/2018 2:00:53 AM$Reviewer: ScreenNamePerson, 35-44 on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$4$I was suicidal (didn't want to wake up, began to consider suicide, every day was arduous, couldn't eat, socializing was difficult, loss of enjoyment of anything, hopeless, etc).  Went on 150 XL and had slight improvement, after 6 weeks went up to 300 XL and more improvement, and began to be able to live a normal life and be myself again.  With the increase to 300 i noticed my ears ring (but i already had tinitis so mostly it's just a worse version of something i'm used to coping with), my mouth is often dry and now and then my lips get super chapped, and the most notable thing is that i have a slight tremor, particularly in my thumbs.  I cannot easily delicately pick up things, which makes picking at food awkward.  It's about 4 months since i first started taking Wellbutrin (i'm on the generic, btw-Medicaid woo!).  The past week the skin around my thumbs has felt kind of thick when i bend them and TODAY i am noticing a stiffness in my left thumb. None of the other side effects alarmed or excessively bothered me enough to go back to being suicidal, but this stiffness is weird, it's like i don't have full range of motion or my thumb just won't go where i want it to.  Texting tonight has been very awkward, and typing is also feeling kind of weird, so this is the first time i've felt uncomfortable about a side effect.  If it worsens I would start to consider changing it up, but that of course is an upsetting thing to have to deal with and invite that kind of chaos and darkness back into my life now that i'm finally getting on track after wasting months laying in bed.  Hope you guys are doing well.

I started on 150mg & about 3 years ago I was moved to 300mg on the Extended Release. I have taken it with prozac as well as lexapro, but I feel like those medicines make me a zombie. Wellbutrin on the other hand seems to make me procrastinate less. It ""turns the volume down"" on the depressing & suicidal thoughts, gives me energy to do things. It does decrease my appetite, which is good because most of us overeat anyway. I'd say over all this medicine has literally been a life saver."

It took a few weeks but turned the dopamine taps back on near full stream again. Side effects I noticed during this time were weightloss, vivid dreams, poor short-term memory, anxiety(never anxious before), sudden and vivid recollection of very old memories, intensified fight or flight response and longer to get back down to the baseline as well as oddly stronger smelling urine. I found greatly restricting caffeine mitigated some of the jitteriness. Even with some of these odd side effects, I found it to be completely worth it for me to find enjoyment in my life again. It is also much much easier to cycle off than SSRI's and can be used for cycles when needed. I found it took about 5 weeks for me to feel full effects.
1524$Condition: Stop Smoking$1/5/2018 8:48:32 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$4$4$ive taken this medicine before and quit after taking it for 3 days. This time though it made me a bit shaky,moody from time to time. But i have noticed that everytime i have taken this medicine to quit smoking I honestly quit within 3 to 4 doses of this medicine. it makes the cig taste really nasty and makes me kind of sick to my stomach if i smoke. I dont really have cravings for a cig after the first few weeks. I did notice it does keep me awake at night more than normal. But nothing that is bothersome. so i would recommend this medicine over chantix anytime. Chantix was bad for me. i would sleep walk and literally cook in the middle of the night and not realize it. i would have such horrific nightmares and so much more. i refuse to take that again. so the  only other medicine i can take is this one. and for me it has worked. i set my quit date for jan 1,2018 and i smoked all the way until 11:30pm the night before. i have been quit ever since without too many issues. but its worth it.

I started at a lower dose and the NPR finally upped it to 450 mg per day (300 in morning and 150 after 12 noon)After I got to 450 I was happy, smiling and ready to do things I had not thought about in quite some time. Then they increased my mood stabilizer (latuda). It did it's job too good and stopped the wellbutrin from increasing my happiness. So, the NPR reduced the Latuda again with the idea that we could increase if necessary but not as much. I am big, 300 pounds, and it is hard to get enough meds in my, large system to do the trick. By going to 450 it made the medicine available and has actually begun to work.Finally a Doc that thinks beyond the label or computer program.

Each increase in dosage was beneficial for about a week, but then I'd hit a plateau. 450 seemed to be the right dose for about 3 weeks, but I've been on this dose for 8 weeks now and feel like the cons are starting to outweigh the pros. I'm not as focused anymore, in fact I've began to have more apathy. My depression hasn't really been helped and I have emotional panic attacks now and then, especially if I drink alcohol-which I was told was the equivalent to completely skipping a dose..makes sense. I've lost 5 lbs, and I'm not binge eating when I feel low, but now I'm obsessed with the weight loss and feel like that's equally problematic. I am less impulsive, but now I seem more obsessive than normal. I've had multiple surgeries in the past 2 years and I was developing a narcotic addiction, within 2 days of taking this medication that craving went completely away, but my ruminating thoughts are increasing again and the impulse to take a pill for no reason but to feel numb is coming back. I take this along with Lamictal, I've been on Lamictal for 3 years, but it wasn't helping with my depression that I cycle with every 6 weeks. I'm ready to get off of this medication, especially since I notice an increase of negative behavior during my menstrual cycle and I'm a week away from another one.

Tried to look up ""Actavis"" pills on ""Pill identifier"" and one of the pills-the 300 mgs., cannot be found so I am going to discontinue with the generic version of this medication and ask for the name brand, as I have heard many mixed/negative reviews for the newer generic versions of this medication. I am told at the pharmacy and by doctors that generics must be bioequivalent to the ""real"" drug and may contain ""other fillers/byproducts"", however, as I have had a generic migraine medicine prescribed that did not work at all-when the ""name brand"" works like a miracle.

I think its anxiety because taking a xanax will alleviate that feeling but really i would rather stay on the immediate release and take it 3x a day rather than this huge 450 mg all at once. Not sure yet if it is working because had a major relapse of major depression. i am praying it works because it's getting old. those of you with recurring depression know the ""crash"" feeling, then the attempt to get back ""up"" and normalize yourself again is so wearing.

The first day I took 150 mg Bupropion (Wellbutrin) I felt less anxious. The night of the second day, I woke up remembering dreams, which I had not done in months, but used to be my usual. According to my psychiatrist it is supposed to increase REM, but many people haven't reported a difference. I happen to experience it. As the first week went on I felt more and more like myself, but with a still slightly drugged feeling. I dropped down to 75mg and my life has been so much easier. I'm not constantly on the edge of feeling like I'm not going to be okay, my suicidal ideation is gone, I can smile and enjoy time with my friends without faking it! It is like I am me again after years of intense MDD and ups and downs (mostly downs) on so many other meds. 
Unfortunately, while all other side effects have ceased, I am continuing to experience a huge amount of hair loss (alopecia) which is a very rare side effect. There is no other drug like this (that works on dopamine and norepinephrine) and therefore no alternatives to try. For now, I'm feeling like I have my life back and I'm not willing to give that up, even if my hair is thinning. "

I gained 20 pounds very easily, completely lost my sex drive and became depressed. I did some research and I started taking the generic form of this drug while weening off of Effexor and had HORRIBLE side effects - dizziness, nausea, and a terrible itchy rash on the inside of my legs. I discontinued the generic version and have started taking Wellbutrin brand name 150 mg once a day. It's only been a couple weeks but I've noticed increased sweating (especially at night - I wake up drenched in sweat and have to change clothes) vivid scary dreams, and today some dizziness. Can anyone tell me if this will subside or if I'm just not meant to take any form of this drug?? I was really hoping to lose some weight and also treat my ADD with this so I could focus at work again. Willing to stick it out for awhile to see if the side effects go away.

I was nauseous and had headaches and wanted nothing to do with cigarettes, so this worked for me I am still smoke free. However the side effects were overwhelming. From Day 1 your mouth is ALWAYS dry.  Waking up in the morning actually hurts your mouth. On the 8th day I could not get out of bed. My joints and muscles were inflamed and ached so bad I couldn't move. I stopped taking wellbutrin immediately and went back to taking my Effexor. It had been 6 days since I quit smoking (I continued smoking for 2 days in the beginning) so I was much better with the withdrawals. If this medication had not affected my legs and arms, I would probably still be taking it. It worked great for smoking cessation and my libido increased.

However, I believe that the SSRIs affect my ability to feel satiated by eating. I started changing to Buproprion to get off Sertraline. So far so good. I am not depressed at all any more, but I have yet to start losing weight. That's more on me and getting back into a routine of physical activity.

I do really like wellbutrin, moreso than SSRIs or SNRIs because it doesn't have quite as bad interactions with illicit drugs (If you're gonna do it at least be kinda smart about it) but mostly because it didn't have as many side effects for me, all I noticed was increased sweating for the first month which has gone away, and my appetite is poor and I lost some weight after I started it, but thats about it.

This medication saved my life and helped me get graduate college. I started feeling better within a week without even trying on 150mg but increased the dose with my doctor to 300mg, which worked the best for me personally. For example, it allowed I was able to stop thinking negatively, could concentrate again, stopped crying all the time, and stabilized my mood at a functional baseline so I could get what I needed out of therapy. All my friends and family told me I was acting more like myself and had my zest for life back. I'm so grateful- before taking it, I did not have enough energy to walk a mile. I had lethargic depression and after taking this medication, I stopped sleeping 14hrs/day, was able to run 3miles like I used to, stopped binge eating, and lost 10lbs after about 5 months on the medication. Once I started getting better (I do not take this medication anymore as my depression resolved after a 9-month combination of Wellbutrin and psychotherapy), I started feeling restless and got agitated, which are side effects and decided with my doctor that I was stable and had enough support in place to stop taking Wellbutrin. I slowly decreased my dose over a month when I did not have a lot of stressful events in my life and consider myself a success story as I rarely have symptoms anymore of MDD. This medication was wonderful and I'm so thankful that it was available when I needed it during the darkest point of my life.

I have been on Wellbutrin XL 300mg for about 2.5 years with extremely positive results. This is the first antidepressant I have ever taken, and I have been much better on it. No more falling through emotional thin ice 20+ times a day, no more crying, and hardly any negative thinking. Started on 150xl for about 1.5-2 months then up to 300XL. 
In the first months experienced almost no side effects save for a few strange new headaches a couple days, but they quickly went away. Only side effect is constipation, which can mostly be mitigated with fiber and good eating. 

I take it in the morning and it has not affected my sleep, though I find I do sleep better and am more refreshed when I occasionally take valerian or even a melatonin/benadryl. 

Last year I felt while I was doing well, but still needed a little umpf to push ahead. Tried the 450mg xl and it was fine for a few days/ a week but proved to be too strong; I felt angry, emotional rollercoaster started again, and couldn’t' focus or concentrate. Back down to 300 and all is well. Cost for brand name is outrageous. From my research decided to stay away from generics, and found a reliable pharmacy to order from for a fraction of the local pharmacy cost.
Exercise is still a must for me to feel O.K.   Not more than 2 days without of I fall back into a slump. Gym used to make me go from a -6 to maybe a 1-3.  Now I go from feeling a 3 to a 9/10 after the gym. "

I'm now out of hospital. Today is day 2 on 300mg. The first day I felt ""weird"" and had a bad headache. Since I am bipolar (manic and depression) I can't tell if the extra energy I'm feeling is due to med. I'm still smoking like a chimney (hopefully the quitting smoking effect will come later). But I do not feel depressed. Some of the comments about bad and real bad side effects scare me. But since my bipolar has gone to the level of causing a psychotic episode I'll give it a whirl. Thank you to all who commented they are helpful in understand this med and remind me I'm not alone with this disorder. "

1609$Condition: Depression$9/25/2014 12:01:37 PM$Reviewer: DJKLondon, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$I am a 47 year old male diagnosed with ADHD combined with bouts of major depression. Over the years I have tried every tricyclic, SSRI, SNRI and atypical antidepressant on the market. While I was taking Ritalin or Dexedrine I never experienced the dpression but I decided that I wanted to go medication-free for my ADHD. I question the wisdom of that decision but anyhow my doctor suggested we try Wellbutrin and I agreed. I started by taking 150mg first thing in the morning and then 300mg every morning since then. It's been about 5 months now and I can't believe the change in how I feel! Wellbutrin lifted me out of the depression right away (ie within 2 days) and it helps with the ADHD symptoms as well. Not to the same extent as the stimulants but it's enough that I can focus now and get tasks completed. I am so thankful for whoever invented bupropion. One think I noticed is that it is closely related to amphetamine and diethylpropion, both used in the past as anti-depressants/anorectics. I believe it is this similarity that gives Wellbutrin the edge over the SSRI's (which are garbage in my opinion)currently in use and I would not hesitate to recommend Wellbutrin, Wellbutrin SR or XL to anyone who is suffering the debilitating symptoms of depression! Two thumbs up for Wellbutrin!

I am 18, and I suffer from anxiety and depression. I started on 150 mg, and then a couple weeks later was upped to 300 mg. I have been on wellbutrin for about 2 months, and have not had a single depressive episode. I was really hoping this would help with my anxiety but it hasn't. Luckily it hasn't made it worse either. Very very happy on/with this drug and it also helps with my ADD! 
1615$Condition: Depression$8/22/2014 9:22:43 AM$Reviewer: katred, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$1$5$"As an antidepressant, it worked wonders within the first week, as the dose was being titrated up.  I had energy and experienced needed weight loss and was very pleased, as I did not do well on SSRI or SNRIs.  Unfortunately, I was not aware that I had a low seizure threshold and by the second week, I had a 15 minute duration grand mal seizure and resulting head trauma.  Therefore, the medication had to be discontinued.  

For individuals NOT prone to seizures, I think this drug could be very useful, but I do think extreme caution should be taken when prescribing to anyone, even is there is no known history of seizure, and it is imperative that front office staff be educated on signs of impending seizure.  

I called the doctor's office to report very uncomfortable side effects that seemed to come on rather quickly (tremor, severe ringing in the ears started overnight during second week of therapy and increased dose) and was told by the receptionist that they couldn't see me that day and ""might be able to work me in the next day"", and to not stop the medication until I spoke to the doctor.  After I hung up the phone, I immediately had my seizure.  I don't know if the agitation of their lack of care brought it on, or if it would have happened at that moment anyway, but I learned to be more insistent with medical staff members after this experience.    

So, overall, a wonderful alternative to SSRI and SNRI meds, but not enough education is provided to the staff at many medical offices and a 'warning sign checklist' needs to be in the patient file whenever this medication is prescribed."

I never felt so good, had energy, got out of bed, exercised, it was unbelievable. However, I lost too much weight and my Dr took me off telling me I had to gain 10 lbs and maintain it for her to put me back on the drug. I gained the weight, was put back on Wellbutrin XL my final dosage was 300.  However, it didn't work at all. I got no relief, nothing that I had experienced the first time I was on the drug. I have been on many anti depressants, and the first time on Wellbutrin was the best. I wonder if anyone else has experienced the same issue.  We tried it again last year, same thing, It eas like taking sugar pills.  I was on the brand as my Dr had had poor results with the generic.  I would give anything to have this drug work again and wonder if there are other reported issues with other patients.  So now my rating is no stars as it doesn't work at all, no matter how we changed the dosage.

1620$Condition: Depression$8/3/2014 6:36:12 PM$Reviewer: LarryV, 55-64 Male  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I've been using Wellbutrin XL 300mg for about 5 years. Prior to it, I was using SSRI type antidepressants. I would recommend anyone with mild depression, which what I have, to try this  first. All the SSRI types caused me to gain weight, feel drowsy during the day, low energy and killed my libido.  Or it did mine. Ladies, if your husband has lost interest in sex while on SSRI's, it is not you. It is the drug. And I would still have bouts with depression. The Wellbutrin XL has none of the above side effects. It's almost the reverse and worked just as good for me as all the newest SSRI meds. Getting off SSRI's can be tough. They have some known withdrawal symptoms. A quick search of those can be found online. I felt like electrical charges were going through my brain and saw flashes of lights. Once that was over and I got on the Wellbutrin, I felt so energized. My libido came back and was higher than before the SSRI's!! I lost 30 pounds too. I tell everyone to try Wellbutrin first. I don't know why doctors don't recommend this medication. My psychiatrist never mentioned Wellbutrin to me. Started me right off with the SSRI's. I did my own research to find them, as I knew I had to get off the others.

I have been on Celexa/citalopram as it seems to work best for me overall. Chronic fatigue is one of my worst symptoms, so as we have many times, my doc and I are supplementing the Celexa with Wellbutrin/bupropion in hopes that the norepi bump would increase my energy. In the past the only difference I noticed was an increase in anxiety, and a practical inability to have an orgasm (anorgasmia.) This time the only difference I notice is anorgasmia. I wanted to post this because I know that Wellbutrin is considered (and shown) to be one of the anti-depressants with the fewest sexual side effects. Experientially, Wellbutrin seems to be essentially worthless as an antidepressant, and exacerbates anxiety. I am thankful I do not smoke, but Wellbutrin is also marketed as Zyban and prescribed for smoking cessation. I do not know what the numbers show for its effectiveness in stopping smoking, but in my humble opinion as anything other than perhaps smoking cessation the med is worthless.

Went to ""top doctors"", acupuncture, chiropractic, etc. the main point is I was told the AMA knows antidepressants have been found to work on specific migraine challenges. For 2 years I tried to get rid of the pain without medication until one day my migraine/stroke symptoms resulted in me thinking I was saying one thing and other words were coming out of my mouth! This terrified me! So I went to a top psychiatrist to see what antidepressant I should take. I had to accept the fact that I could not naturally get rid of my pain! This was in 1995. 

After much discussion it was decided that Wellbutrin would be the best medication with the least long term and short term side effects. I took the sample home and decided to work from home for a few days so I could take the medication safely. 

I will never forget this experience, it saved my life! Sitting at my dining room table, 45 minutes after taking the pill, doing paperwork when all of a sudden I felt a tingling sensation in the shape and size of a baseball at the exact location of my neck injury! I knew then that this medication would work. ( please understand that I was told not to expect any improvement for about 2 weeks!) we had to up the med once within in 2 months and that was it! Thru the years I have gone to the next generations, using the latest now. I cannot use the generic, it does not work the same and there are side effects! Most doctors know this but still people are forced to buy the generic due to cost factors. This is one medication no generic should be approved! 

Bottom line, I am fine. Thank Heavens! Hope this helps someone. "

He has had no side effects and sleeps like a baby. I have had an average of 2 to 3 hours of sleep a night, lost 12 lbs., very rapid heartbeat, no appetite, rapid speech and feel like I'm on amphetamines! Every person is different. What works for one person doesn't work for another. My husband thinks because I'm high strung to begin with and on the hyper side, I had bad side effects. I've stopped taking this 3 days ago and still not sleeping. Doctor put me on Ambien and I fall asleep but can't stay asleep more than a couple hours. Guess I have to give it time to get completely out of my system. It can help you stop if you can take it!

Every once in a while I feel a few thump s in my chest but it's not painful. I've had 0 side effects. It feels great to be able to feel a full range of emotions without being altered by meds.

I have been taking Prozac for 2 years and it helps but didn't quite get me to feeling good most of the time (just less bad than I was). Adding Wellbutrin (you can take both) has made all the difference. And it has really helped me focus on work. Prior to Wellbutrin I would start to work and then get quickly bored or distracted and do something else. I had a hard time just getting something started. Wellbutrin has made a very big change in this area. I still get distracted a little but not as much. I may ask to try 300mg when I go see my Dr. But I'm much better off than I was. I didn't even know that I had ADD symptoms, but now I think that's probably what I have had. I am so much happier. Only side effect I notice is that I seem to sleep harder. But that's not a bad thing.

You do have to be determined but it helped and I am still nt smoking and I havent taken the mediaction in about four months.

Pretty much every side affect has increased, but it still helps me with mood swings, anger issues, cry very little and have hardly any anxiety. I can still function on this medication better than any other meds in the past. For me it's worth the side effects, for now. know this, I also take other medications along with wellbutrin.

That's why i switched from lexapro to it. But, Wellbutrin causes me to have contstipation. The constipation caused me to have severe diareha when I used dolcolax which landed me in the ER. And during that stay I was diagnosed with ischemic colitis, which may be caused by as many as 20 things or more, but in my case is likely due to meds. Long story short I'm quitting wellbutrin and looking for an alternative.

Usually I don't experience side effects and boy was I in for a rude awakening when the doctor put me on this. It took 3-4 weeks for my migraines, cotton mouth to subside but I continued to experience dizziness and I had a lot of trouble with zoning out. My Dr. adjusted my dosage about 4 times in the course of a year before finally taking me off of it. It defiantly wasn't my cup of tea, but i've heard it worked wonders for other patients.

I am able to get up each morning with a positive outlook. I began cleaning, exercising, reading, meeting up with friends and properly caring for my daughter again. I have had no ill side effects except that I am hungry all the time and need to watch what I eat (holy sugar cravings!). The only aspect of my depression I am still struggling with is obsessive thinking, but I began cognitive behavioral therapy to address this. Overall, I am happy with this medication so far.

1685$Condition: Depression$1/23/2014 2:52:31 PM$Reviewer: happycamper, 55-64 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$4$5$I have been taking the generic form of Welbutrin (300 mg/day)for the past 3 years for chronic, low-level depression.  It has really helped me be more positive, less anxious, and more focused at work. On rare occasion, when under unusual stress, I take 10 mg of Xanax (in addition to Welbutrin) to help combat my anxiety.  I took Prozac for two years prior to starting on Welbutrin, but it just made me feel emotionally numb and finally stopped working altogether. I have had no adverse side-effects from Welbutrin and have lost the extra weight I gained while on Prozac.  It has not increased my sex-drive (unlike some other reviewers); however, it hasn't diminished it either.  I would highly recommend this drug to anyone suffering from low-level depression; although, I know everyone reacts differently.  My 18-yr-old daughter, who has ADD (inattentive type), was recently diagnosed with depression as well.  She just started taking Wellbutrin this past week (75 mg/day initially, increasing to 150 mg/day next week).  Hopefully, it will help her as much as it has helped me. (She also takes Concerta and Focalin for her ADD).

1687$Condition: Depression$1/20/2014 5:47:27 AM$Reviewer: Frank, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$I had tried two other drugs in the past 10 years (SSRI).  I was almost ready to give up but then gave Wellbutrin a try.  The adjustment period was hardly noticeable.  I did have a few nights of restlessness and some night sweats in the first two weeks.  The only major side effect was a major increase in sex drive.  I already had a  high sex drive but this was ridiculous!  Just having thoughts of making love to my spouse brought me to the point of orgasm, while at work!  For a few days, I was going nuts with sexual desire.  Eventually, this side effect ended by the start of week three.  Now, after two months, I'm feeling much more calm and in control of my emotions.  Thoughts of suicide continued in the first few weeks.  Now, after a couple of months, those feelings are gone too.  I also no longer have any desire to smoke and other habitual desires are also gone.  My stuttering, and fast speech and anxiety are also more in control.  Overall, this is my miracle drug.  Can't say it will be the same for you, but for me, life is now grand and improving.

My doctor was good and just kept arguing with them.  I finally told the insurance I was going to switch since I could not get the meds I needed.  They approved the BRAND name for use the following month and I have had no issues.  Good luck to you!

1690$Condition: Depression$1/16/2014 12:08:01 PM$Reviewer: Katherine, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $4$4$4$I initially started Wellbutrin at 300 mg/day (150 mg twice per day) in 2005 along with Celexa at 20 mg due to depression and anxiety. I eventually stopped taking Wellbutrin when my Celexa dose was increased to 60 mg which appeared to be the right dose/medication for me. I was recently reduced to 40 mg of Celexa due to new studies that no more than 40 mg should be taken due to risk of heart issues/death. I am now back on Wellbutrin at 300 mg/day due to the decreased dosage of Celexa. Wellbutrin has worked for me. Side effects included decreased appetite, a little weight loss initially and dry mouth. I am a smoker and I thought Wellbutrin might help with that too, however, I did not notice any decrease in cigarette cravings while on Wellbutrin. The only thing I STRONGLY caution is do not EVER take more than your prescribed amount of Wellbutrin. I overdosed by accident (took 600 mg in one day) about 2 years after I started taking it, it was the worst experience of my life. Hallucinations, paranoia, insomnia....I literally thought I was dead and everyone around me was a ghost. I ended up going to the ER because of it (I actually thought my dead body was at the hospital and I wanted to go there to wake myself up). NEVER, EVER overdose on this medication. You will be sorry! But again, taken as prescribed, I am pleased with it.

1692$Condition: Depression$1/11/2014 10:49:51 AM$Reviewer: RxLisa, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$4$5$I have been taking Wellbutrin XL 300 mg for about 5 weeks now (started on 150 mg).  This has been much more effective than any other antidepressant I've taken.  In the past 20 years I've been on Prozac, Celexa, Zoloft (with and without Abilify) and also Deplin.  The first couple of weeks, I was a bit more irritable, but was ok with it, because I cared about things again and was engaging again in life.  I was mostly irritated at how I had let everything go because I just didn't care or have the energy to do anything.  In the last couple of weeks, I have developed neck pain, headaches, and intermittently blurry vision, which all are listed possible side effects.  It's working so well for my depression at this point that I'm willing to wait a couple of months to see if the side effects go away.  I'm not sure if I've lost weight, but I'm cooking more often and eating less.  With all the other meds I've tried, it was the other way around.  All medications have side effects, these, for me are tolerable to be able to enjoy my young children and actually enjoy life again.  Before Wellbutrin, I was just kind of dragging myself through life.  I've had depression pretty much my entire adult life and tried it with and without antidepressants.  So far, With Wellbutrin XL, I feel like myself again for the first time in a very long time.

I was so hopeful as I've had a horrible time with weight gain on antidepressants, going from 120lbs to 180! Sadly, the first day I was on this pill I had hand tremors and dizziness. The second day I had minor chest pain and my anxiety skyrocketed. It's now the third day and I had horrible cold sweats earlier, and still intermittent chest pain, so I'm stopping. This is obviously not a pill that's good for anxiety, regardless of what my doctor says. I now feel like I've rewound my progress and have to start again thanks to this drug.

I was taking this medication a long with others to help with my Bipolar. Everything was going great, but I didn't know I was very sensitive to medications. I started having petite mal seizures, many times a day and all through the night. I'm even on Topmax which is an antidepressant/anti seizure medication, and I was still having seizures. My doctor took me off the wellbutrin and my seizures have stopped,  but my mood is going down hill. It's a great medication other than the side affects.

Co-workers suggest Wellbutrin and had weight loss effects and were very satisfied.  Thought I would try it.  I weaned off Celexa and started Wellbutrin 150 for two weeks but no satisfaction.  Increased to 300 by PCP and thought all was well.  One night about 9 I noticed I started itching at my ankle.  In an hour I had itchiness on legs and by 10 hives and welts on inner thights, backside, back of legs.  Lay awake until 3 am itching then noted hives and welts on abdomen, chest, underarms, under breasts and sides.  Became worried for spreading to my face or even tongue.  I drove to ER at hospital and treated with Benedryl and Prednisone immediately. 4 days later and I lost movement in my right thumb and hand very painful.  Went to ortho who have me injection and told me it was results from inflammationof the drug.  Today my hands are swollen and hurt badly and I am told it takes time to go thru system.  I am so dreadfully sorry that I switched medications and then again thank God for allowing me to live.  Never thought I would ever have a reaction and I guess time will heal.  I would rather be happy and healthy and perhaps a few pounds over weight than go thru what I have in the past week.

The reaction is often misdiagnosed as a virus, as was in my daughter's case.  After two clinic visits and two trips to the ER, she finally was diagnosed correctly, but had to be hospitalized for a week.   She gained 30 lbs. of fluid in just a few days and was covered with a beet-red rash.  Her major organs were also affected.  She had to be treated with steroids, which is another side-effect story.  Be your own advocate-  if you develop a rash while taking any prescription drug, take it seriously!   Your life depends on it.  DRESS Syndrome is a living nightmare and too many doctors do not have the expertise to recognize it.

This medicine has helped my depression a lot! I feel much happier now. HOWEVER I have horrible and possibly serious side effects. I am nauseous and throw up nearly every day. I'm also dizzy and feel very weak. My heartbeat is irregular and often feels very fast. I have a general feeling of being sick and often feel like I'm going to faint. I'm going to talk to my doctor about these effects soon and will most likely need to go off this medication. It's very frustrating to find a medicine that helps with my depression and then find out that it gives me terrible side effects :(

I stopped taking the other antidepressants and continued, but then couldn't afford the brand and started the generic. Awful; dry mouth, anger, sleeplessness, mood swings, and stomach aches; I feared long term effects and so I quit taking Celexa and bupropion over two weeks. It was truly horrible; crawly skin, agitation, depression, anger, disorientation and nausea. I lived in a bathtub for two days to calm my skin symptoms and calm my nerves. Six years later I still experience these same symptoms, although not as pronounced. I don't feel my brain/body is the same and I'm staying away from drugs now. Healthy diet, exercise and cognitive therapy as opposed to ""take the pill"". Being open with my friends and confessing feelings often helps. I still wake regularly agitated and upset/angry over something that is nothing later on when I'm rested and awake--so agitated I could be awake all night. I wouldn't do it again; I'd take care of health by going to a spa and getting verbal/understanding/relational therapy. Finding a decent counsellor is difficult, but persist. A mentor, a priest, a mature relative--these people can give a 'reality picture' or feedback so you can get grounded over time. It's not just understanding yourself; it's finding a real relationship that can go deeper than becoming a good social character. Someone to confide your soul with...don't stop looking but use your discrimination and don't just confide in anyone. Really know and watch the actions of this person for character and their own self-understanding. If you are really looking sincerely, someone will appear and not necessarily cost you $100. an hour. For me, it was a woman in my church. Good luck to you...

As soon as I started the increased dose, all the side effects came on. I went from being depressed sometimes to being constantly down. Sometimes I was unable to get out of bed and do the basic everyday things. I started having hallucinations, feeling disoriented and having blackouts. I used to be very active and worked out 5 days a week. I gained 20 lbs while I was on it. The more I excercise and watched my diet, the more weight I gained. My doctor insisted that I may have had a previous underlying condition not related to the drugs. She also said she would consult a neurologist on my behalf. While I waited for her feedback, I did some research online and saw that my symptoms may be seizures (which I never had before taking the drugs). She told me that the neurologist suggested I stopped the meds as it appears I was having seizures. Within 2 weeks after I stopped taking them, the symptoms stopped. Ironic that I may have ended up taking anti-seizure meds to fix the side effects of another drug that was supposed to help me. My doctor still insists that this is the best out there at this time. Would love to try the name brand but my insurance only covers generic at the co-pay price. If I want the original, I will have to pay almost $1000 per month which I cannot afford. "

On the second or third day, I noticed a few red dots around my mouth with a white head. After my shower I gently scrapped of the white head (it was very small). By the 6th day I was still very sick to my stomach, had a severe headache and the tiny whiteheads (rash?) had turned huge and they covered my entire mouth area, upper lip and my nose, my cheeks and also my back and breasts. When I took a shower I used mild soap and gently washed these areas, no matter how gentle I was they would all start to bleed and it would not stop. I had to hold a tissue on my entire face for up to 15 minutes with pressure. The rest of the skin on my face was ""dead"" that is the only way I can explain it. I could rub my fingers across my forehead or my upper cheeks and the entire first layer would rub off into large clumps of skin. I stopped taking Wellbutrin after a week and a half. the nausea is gone, the headaches are less frequent and not as intense however my face has over 30 red pimples, scabs, an area of a rash including my back and breasts.

My appetite decreased ,I had more energy sound good but the really bad side is. I experienced a title wave of emotions.I became so so angry and ruminated over all wrongs that had happened to me , my grief was raw, a new doctor put me on 5mg lexapro and cut the Wellbutrin in half, just started and will post my results. I suffer from mild to moderate anxiety and had several deaths in my family. Bottom line start low go slow and listen to others around you if they tell you you are different.

In turn, it makes my moods elevated; for instance, if I get happy it goes to this hyper happy and when I get mad I get almost to the point of violence. My psychologist thinks it is helping my depression, but I don't think it's doing much. I am bipolar - mania and I was put on Seroquel. I think the Seroquel has helped me more than anything. Wellbutrin isn't that good in my opinion. And when my mom tried to take it, she broke out in hives.

Now I'm getting ready for an appointment to see the neurologist for an official diagnosis. I'm not sure if the name brand itself would have brought on the same results but I've been hearing too many negative feedback about the generic versions. Also not very pleased with my insurance for insisting that I take generic. The told me that if I want the name brand my copay would be about $300 for a 30 day supply (generic is only $15 for a 30 day supply). My doctor switched me to another newer brand which I am slowly adjusting to.

Some people seem to be under the impression that its a stimulant but no way (I am actually on add meds so I know the difference): just wait until you've been on it for a full month, then you'll see! You'll see that it's like any other antidepressant in that it turns you into an apathetic zombie only you'll be way less choosy and you'll eat anything in sight.  I also found that this stuff DID NOT help my ADD in ANY way, but then again I actually have add for reals and am not just self-diagnosing myself.  I believe this could help calm hyperactivity though, so maybe it's good ADHD.

I asked my doctor about Wellbutrin XL as it is different than a lot of the ""common"" anit depressants because it effects your brain differently. I felt better on Wellburtin in less than 2 weeks. Yes I got a little ""bouncy"" and ""overly excited"" but that's why we're taking these drugs right...TO BE HAPPY AND NOT DEPRESSED!!!! I get out more, I enjoy walking my dog more it's not a ""chore"" as it used to be. I know there's no ""magic pill"" but for me it's been great and I've been on it ALL from Prozac to Paxil to Zoloft to Prestique to Cymbalta so I think I know what I'm talking about here!!! "

It didn't help me to quit smoking, I did lose a few pounds in the beginning though.  After taking for a week or so I start having trouble sleeping at night. I'm wide awake after 4 hours of sleep but it only lasts for a couple of weeks and then I sleep fine.  They both make me a little scatter brained but especially the 300mg.  It's hard to concentrate.  But as far as the depression goes its great.  The GENERIC did not work AT ALL!  I've had many rounds with my insurance getting them to pay for the name brand but the generic simply did nothing for me.  My doctor had to call them and write on the prescription ""Name brand medically necessary"".  Increase thirst is the only side affect.  It's easy to wean yourself off of these. I don't recommend quitting cold turkey.  Hope this helps someone."

I dont dwell on issues any longer like I used to and it has helped me to prioitize what is important.  I have more of a level head rather than feeling like every problem was a huge issue. most importanty I laugh again.  it has increased my sex drive and I realize the important things in life.  I was feeling like being a mother was more of a chore, now I enjoy spending time with my family again.  I would recomend this drug to someone that is depressed and or wants to quit smoking.  I have had very little side effects.  I do get headaches more freakenly but it is much better than what I was feeling prior to being on the drug.

First thing I noticed on the second day of taking it was that I was unusually short of breath, and my heart started being quickly randomly throughout the day. On the fifth day I woke up with a sore left arm, and the pain spread to the left side of my chest. Developed chest pressure and that continued on for the full 8 days that I took the medication and ended when I went off the medicine. My anxiety also seemed to have increased; I could never calm down and my body always felt heavy. However, the only somewhat positive thing I can mention is that I felt that this medicine kind of woke me up a bit; before I was pretty numb, but I started feeling again. The side effects were enough to make me go off of it within 8 days. I hope to try the name brand Wellbutrin to see if there is an improvement.

But feel I can be focused when I need to be. I take when go to bed and I don't have insomnia, nor do I wake up real groggy (which was a problem when I initially tried taking it in the morning). Agree that you MUST stay with name brand, or try ""Watson"" generic. ""Teva"" is horrendous though. Ruined one of my vacations when the pharmacy switched me from Watson to Teva and I didn't realize there would be a difference but it was an awful experience. I do prefer name brand though. I don't understand why it has to be so expensive."

I have been on it for 12 years. I originally took 150mg once a day; moved up to twice a day but switched to 300mg slow release so I wouldn't forget to take one of the doses. I tried so many different drugs over the past 20 years that I've lost count and the side affects were often horrific. Once my psychologist recommended Wellbutrin and my psychiatrist concurred I have never switched and it is the only anti-depressant I take. I also dropped 20 lbs of the 30 the other drugs had caused me to gain. It has helped with ADD, SAD and the all encompassing symptoms of depression. There have been a few times during the years when I was unable to take it for several days in a row and you could tell but just one dose and I was back up feeling great. I'm sorry it doesn't work for everyone; it has so few uncomfortable side affects when compared to some of the newer drugs. But for those who have found relief I can tell you that after all these years I still have found relief. (My husband calls them my happy pills!)

Foggy head, slow thought process, disinterest in sexual relations, minimal positive effects. I am quitting smoking and may be Bipolar so we tried Wellbutrin XL, 150mg. Severely decreases my interest in cigarettes/nicotine. Does not affect my thought processes [after the first week or two], my intimate life, or my sleep [provided i take it in the morning]. I do seem to drop things more often, but that declines as time goes on. I feel normal. It's the perfect medication for me. I recommend discussing it with your doctor to anyone with more than one issue potentially going on, that focuses more on depression than anxiety attacks. [in my case, smoking, depression, potential bipolar, probably ADD]

1915$Condition: Depression$4/21/2012 4:30:52 PM$Reviewer: Olythia, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$4$5$"Started these about 2 years ago after being  desperate because none of those that act on serotonin had worked for me. Best thing I ever did! I researched it on-line and found the ratio of people praising it to hating it was much more favourable than most other anti-depressants. Problem: I'm in the UK and it is only licensed for giving up smoking. So I have to order it from Europe or USA. I started by taking just a quarter of one 150mg tab and working up to the full dose by day 7. (different for everyone of course)

Doing it this way made it much easier on the side-effects which for me were itchy rash on my hand and foot and difficulty getting to sleep maybe a bit of nausea but I found if I  ate some food with them it helped -even though my research said it shouldn't affect. I have read that taking a quarter of a tablet and building up gradually to lessen side-effects doesn't work. It really does for me. Bupropion has made me feel completely ""normal"" I didn't feel like I was on medication at all, until recently. After about a year and half I found I got occasional head pains. Not a headache as such. If I lay down on my front suddenly to watch television or something like that i would get a sharp pressure-like pain. I would keep still or slowly sit up and it would pass. after a few months I gradually started to get a slight hang-over feeling for a few hours most days. without any changes to my diet etc. I don't normally get headaches. My delivery was very delayed recently and I literally ran out. I was very worried what would happen with suddenly stopping (i could not get any from the doctor of course) Nothing happened so I stayed off them for two months. I can now very slightly feel anxiety on waking up that I used to get but only slightly so I decided to start again rather than wait until it gets bad. Today is the first day and I have a bit of that slight tightness in the head feeling. Anyone else had similar?"

It caused my thoughts and behavior to be out of control.  I took it because my former MD said, ""if you have chronic pain you also have depression"". I have never been depressed in my life yet placed on Prozac and changed to Wellbutrin. This medication made me end up in a mental health ward where doctors automatically place a person on anti-psych drugs. Anti-psych medications are scary and should never be given to patients automatically.  Wellbutrin made my thoughts and actions so crazy and doctors since have told me that this is a common side affect.  Scary thought! Due to the fact I was discharged on these crazy drugs to take at home I continued to have scary thoughts and odd behavior.  This has been a nightmare that I would not wish on my worse enemy. Ive been in and out of psych wards for four years due to drugs that are on the market and we are told we must take the medicine a doctor orders. The ER doctor sees my medical records of a former  mental illness and then send me back to be committed to a mental ward with several E.R.visits. It was a revolving door as I would be once again on medicine that alters ones thoughts and behavior. I am lucky as my doctor got me off of Wellbutrin and every time I have been forced into a mental health ward by an emergency room doctor, my doctor weans me off of these terrible drugs and I am back to my old self.  I never had a history of mental illness until I started taking Wellbutrin and then being forced to take anti-psych medications will make your brain think things you wouldn't believe and behave in an out-of-control manner.

Increased because I wasn't feeling as good any more.  Can't say I'm feeling much better, the sleeplessness has been terrible.  I'm seriously considering going back to the lower dose.
I originally started on Wellbutrin XL after participating in a double blind drug study for depression.  Wellbutrin combined with Cymbalta was the study administrator's best guess as to what I had been taking. This is not a usual drug combination, but it has done wonders for me. I am able to hold down a full time job in an extremely detailed position.  I'm known at work for my calmness! "

By the 3rd day i started thinking about  death constantly.it wasnt suicidal thoughts just obsessive thoughts of dying and my funeral and that it was going to happen soon. By the fifth day i started to get scared because i was  thinking about running my car off the road and i knew since i have battled depression since i was sixteen  that these thoughts were  and not normal for me and instead of being melodramatic about how horrible life was i was internally obsessing over these dark thoughts . it was very scary and stopped taking it immediately. after i stopped wellbutrien the morbid thoughts stopped. very weird.

I am just now seeing a difference. As each individual is different so do I believe how long or how soon it takes for antidepressant to kick in. I did experience some "" sudden anger"" moments but those too are starting to go away. I had been on Prozac for many years and it was not working anymore so doc prescribed wellbutrin. I think the transision between the two drugs is what caused some of my uneasy feelings but is better now. My advice is, give the drug time to get in your system before dismissing it. As stated everyone is different and it may just take longer for some to feel the effectiveness . It's helped me so far and anticipate it getting better everyday."

The problem I'm having now is, instead of lack of sex drive I'm like a 16 year old again (but I last just as long as well). I don't know if switching to this medication has brought life back into certain parts of my body that i had forgotten about (doubtful) or the medication is making me SUPER sensitive. Either way, I don't like it. Also, I get agitated fast and I'm slightly more emotional. Looking for alternative medication... any suggestions?? Anyone?

I have been on multiple drugs for my depression over the last several years and in and out of the hospital several times also.  I was put on the Welbutrin after my last hospitalization for attempting to take my own life earlier this year(2011).  I am currently on the maximum dose and I also take Lamictal(100mg)and Remeron(30 mg) to help with sleep.  I was like a zombie with the 5 meds I was on before my suicide attempt now I feel so much better.  For the first time in 6 yrs I have my energy back, I'm not falling asleep during the day,I am hopeful instead of hopeless and I am back working after an extended medicalleave.  I do see a therapist in addition to the medication currently and attribute the success of my recovery to the combination of the new medicine, therapy and the intensive care I received in my week and a half stay at a psychiatric hospital 6 months ago but I believe the medication change to Welbutrin has made a huge difference.  I hope my experience is helpful to someone out there who is suffering from this medical illness that can be difficult to treat.

And I find it to be a lot better than zoloft. And it doesn't take away my sex drive the zoloft did. It doesn't make me drowsy either. Nor does it keep me awake at night staring at the ceiling the other antidepressants have done in the past. I take it along with seroquel 75mg at bedtime and I'm able to fall asleep without any problems. The biggest complaint I have regarding seroquel is tha it makes me crave sweets and other foods, so you really have to excercise discipline as far a healthy diet is concerned (but its not easy) because seroquel raises glucose levels and can cause diabetes, so you really have to try and limit you carbohydrates as well. Other than that, I'm satified for now.

I was nagged by an underlying feeling of anxiety and nauseous stomach.  It definitely improved my sex life.  I had been on Cymbalta and it worked well except in the bedroom.  I give Wellbutrin an OK.  I really need something more effective for depression.  I may take the leap to a new drug called Viibryd which is hyped as offering good depression relief without the sex problems.  I first got on Wellbutrin to knock out the Cymbalta sex effects.  It didn't work.  I may find myself on it to aid the Viibryd if it turns out to be problematic.  Anyway, good luck with Wellbutrin.  If it works for you..that's great.

My symptoms of anxiety/depression worsened within days after starting this new Rx. I turned into a raving lunatic, talking non-stop, not able to stay focused on tasks at work. I was miserable, nervous, angry, sad, never satisfied. Did nothing for the low sex drive. Demanded to be taken off after a month. 6 months later I am still hearing tidbits of what I was like when I was on Wellbutrin, in fact I can say I was almost fired by my employer because of certain things I spewed out of my mouth without regard to anyone's feelings. I am now taking Cipralex 20mg once in the morning. I have been taking antidepressants for most of 15 years. Generally, I feel better but you have to realize there isn't a magic pill, you have to find one that works for you.

First time I took this about 5 years ago I was literally having sexual urges constantly so my doctor took me off it after a month of ""bliss but agony"". Well, speaking to my psychiatrist who specializes in meds and heads the state board where I live, Wellbutrin was actually considered being used as a drug for lacking sexual desire when they did their initial studies. This was due to the results of the initial tests showing increased sexual desire of women and actual orgasm without stimulation. It was being studied at this time to see positive effects for depression. It helped me the first time I took it although I felt like a nympho. Back on it again 3 years ago to help libido but doing nothing but causing constipation...no sexual desire at all. Actually wish I was experiencing my initial use ""urges"" that caused me to stop it, was having ""almost orgasms"" at work and couldn't concentrate."

It made my husband happy, but being that I couldn't get enough I went outside the marriage to be satisfied. It almost seemed to put me in a bipolar state. It never happened before and it never happened since. Keep in mind I am not blaming this all on the drug because I was feeling like i wasn't getting enough attention at home and these other men provided that for me. It just seems an odd coincidence that this all started 4 weeks after i was put on wellbutrin. No problems since i got off the medication.

At first it was just anxiety, but as the years have gone by I developed severe depression on top of it. I've tried just about every kind of ""depression"" medication on the planet, and Wellbutrin (the generic, Buproprion) has been the one that's helped me the most. The depression has gotten 90% better during the time I've been taking it. Still have anxiety issues (but I've got Xanax for that...LOL)...but I'd rather be anxious than depressed any day.
I have to take this medication in the morning, otherwise it's hard to get to sleep at night. And I'm carrying around several extra pounds, but I think that all depression meds make you gain weight. 

After reading some of these reviews, it's obvious that everyone reacts differently to this medication as far as ""side effects"" are concerned. For the first week after I started taking it, side effects were a little rough...my hands shook really bad at times, I had a hard time sleeping, and I was a little nauseated. After my body adjusted to it (and it takes about a week) the symptoms subsided & everything was fine.

On the plus side ~ after I'd been taking Wellbutrin for about 6 months, I quit smoking. One of the nice little side effects of this medication. ; )

If you have depression and haven't tried Wellbutrin yet, give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised.

Couldn't have a drink, a cup of coffee, or even take an ibuprofen without feeling just awful. So I stopped. That was 2 years ago. Not the end of the story, however. Every 2 months or so I get what I call ""flashbacks"" where I have episodes of the exact same symptoms that last about 3 days. This stuff tried to take my body over and it still doesn't want to let go. I curse the day I took it."

I went from bad to worse, if I wasn't crying then I wanted to kill everyone! My fiance and I never fought, never doubted each other and always loved on each other. After taking this we were fighting constantly, I was accussing him of cheating on me(at least my brain was telling me that, my heart knew better) I didn't want anything to do with him or the kids, work or even the house. I cried when I knew it was time to go home, how pathetic is that!!! All I can say is I hope that if you try this then expect the worse, hope for the best! I will NEVER take this medicine again, even if its the smallest dose known to man!!!

That did not work AT ALL. Completely different exprience.
After a divorce, losing both parents (within 7 months) and the recent loss of both my dogs, Wellbutrin just doesn't seem to be effective anymore. My doc tried adding different medications along with it, but weird side effects (from the newer additions) have kept me on Wellbutrin. I'm ready for a change as I think this has lost some effectivness.
Overall, no real side effects with Wellbutrin XL except for losing a few pounds, but nothing major. Just wish it would have kept on working. Maybe my issues are just too much for it."

Trouble Sleeping- I have the best sleep since I stated taking it.  Now I do have the dry mouth, strange taste in the mouth, but that’s all taken care of with a piece of gum.So are these considered uncomfortable, I dont know. I am taking the generic version, so as for the depression, I feel mellow and calm while at work. But when I get home, I feel like I took a energy shot. I don’t feel moody any more, and I am spending more time with my kids outside, showing my husband more affection. So far this is the best thing I’ve been on.

Pros: has decreased cravings, allowed me to stop and think before i do impulsive self-destructive behaviors (SBDs), reduced All-or-Nothing (AON)thinking with bingeing, reduces bingeing (best thing ever)also reduced depressive episodes gets rid of hopelessness feeling. OH AND INCREASES SEX DRIVE FROM BASICALLY ZERO TO A LOT.
Cons: nausea, shaky hands, dry mouth for a week. Makes me manic a lot more- get angry and very hyper during the episodes. i stopped taking it for this reason for 3 days and became very dpressed. hopelessness, called suicide hotline (never been like this before) altho my life ssucks rite now so that was part of it. went back on it and the mania has lessened. this drug also decreased my alcohol tolerance from low to basically zero- ystrday i got drunk off of half a bottle of beer, felt dizzier than usual. im pretty sure im not supposed to be drinking with all the meds im on (increased seizure risk) but im in college so thats not going to happen, you should probably talk to your doc about this.
overall i like this drug i have been trying to get it for years bcuz of the weightloss potential. im taking 2 other psychotropic meds so that may affect results. "

I could not get a good breath in- it was tight and no matter how hard I tried, it would take 5 or 6 deep breaths/yawns before I got one breath, then the process would start over. I had chest pain/tightness and an incredibly fast heartbeat. I exercise regularly and am only 24, so this was unusual. I ended up in the ER because my chest hurt so bad I worried I was damaging my heart. They couldn't find anything and wouldn't believe my generic accusation, until a social worker called a psychiatrist who confirmed my symptoms as a common side effect from this generic. I took Wellbutrin for anxiety and depression 8 years ago, and I was fine. I know my body has changed, but I believe this generic may be dangerous for some. With coupons, my co-pay will be $230... so now I will be either fighting or beginning again the struggle to find an adequate medication."

My doctor thought perhaps it would help with my obsessive/compulsive behavior.  It did not do anything for that.  I guess it helped with depression somewhat.  The problem arose when I noticed any time I'd lie down, whatever thought was in my head would vaporize.  Trying to remember exactly what I'd been thinking would not get it back to save my soul.  Sometimes, I would write down my thoughts, then lie down just to see if they'd go poof (they would)---at least I could read about what was on my mind just minutes before.  However, even reading the subject would not return the thoughts themselves.  When I brought this up to my doctor, he said, ""Uh-oh.""  Apparently, I was suffering seizures on Wellbutrin, which caused my mind to reset to 0.  I was immediately taken off this drug and another was tried--and another--whichever had the best sales pitch.  I ultimately did find an extended-release antidepressant that works perfectly for my particular needs.  "

According to one article, it's the patented membrane that allows for extended release that seems to be the problem. Apparently some generics don't use the same XR method, which can lead to a huge release of the active ingredient followed by little to no release. Wellbutrin has a membrane-like wall that allows a constant release, but many generics use pills that just dissolve slowly. Other bodily functions can speed up or slow down the release (i.e., amount of food in stomach). Just thought this was interesting so I'm passing it along and will also ask my doctor about it.  http://www.prevention.com/health/health/healthy-l iving/find-out-how-to-use-generic-drugs-safely/ar ticle/ca929d93636d6110VgnVCM10000013281eac____

I've always been lucky in life and have had a great family and basically everything a child could ask for. Although, I've had some tramatic experences in my childhood my parents where in the process of getting a divorce, my father committed sucide when i was nine, and i had to move 3 years later due to expensive living in New York. After i moved  to the south it was a major culture shock and sunk into a depression. I was always a bigger taller girl which affected my self esteem, when i was 13 i weighted around 135 lbs and was 5'4. Over two years i gained 60 lbs and 3 cup sizes and am now 5'7, thankfully i still had a shaply hourglass proportion. Finally when i was around 195 lbs. i was severly depressed and though ""how did this happen"" and ""why did i let myself go"" Everyone said you look fine your a beautiful girl. Thankfully not to toot my own horne, but i am an attractive girl and look very mature for my age but that didn't matter i felt horrible. In 09 my doctor prescribed me Prozac 20 mg and i didn't like the though of being on medicine so i didn't take it reguarly  which is bad. It made my tired and it just did not work. My doctor was a prozac pusher lol. To make a long story short in October 2010 i wanted another advise and saw another doctor and he put me on WELLBUTRIN XL 150 Mg later uped me to 300mg. I though wow thats so much medicine compared to 20mg but he explained to me how it works differently and it has different mg and 150 isn't so much. 4 Months later now Feb 2011 i feel great and have lost 45 lbs in 3 months. The medicine isn't  a miracle drug or a weight loss drug. It just helps you feel like yourself, actually i felt like i wasn't on meds. It helps motivate you to help yourself and get back on track and boosts energy. It severly decressed my hunger which was a super plus and motivated me to start working out. 4 months later with watching what i eat (even over the winter holidays) an"

It's such a waste of a drug to take, and a waste of my money, i wouldn't even think of recommending it to anyone.

That's all changed now. I am very happy with the effects. I started at 150 mg for about 2 weeks and didn't feel much... then started on 300 mg once a day and voila, I felt a strong difference in my mood, no more nagging negative thoughts, increased ability to not only handle the stress, but become a strong leader in my family and help others develop a more positive attitude and perspective. I recommend this drug, but like everyone else says, hopefully not as a permanent way to deal with life. Once some of the challenges I am going through have been resolved, I plan to slowly taper off of this drug altogether. It is the ONLY drug that I take.

Basically it causes sexual side effects and fatigue and does little else for my mental or emotional state. A fairly safe drug side effect wise I guess but I am still massively depressed.

I have been on this drug for 4 weeks. I take 150mg. Works well. I had no symptoms of PMS other than a headache which is normal. I have become more energetic, think clearer, and focused. I have also lost 5lbs so far. Side effects experienced are - dry mouth, dry lips, trouble sleeping (I can stay awake like I'm a teen again)some constipation at first, and I had one dizzy spell that lasted about 3 secs. I possibly had a headache or two. I suffer from migraines also. I do eat less since I am focused, I'm not constantly reaching for food. I am in school and can actually read a chapter and remember what I read. I still over react some but have only been on the drug 4 weeks. I don't dwell on things like that anymore. Once they happen, it quickly goes away. I love this drug so far. My pharmacy tried to make me take the generic. I gave it back and asked for the Brand. I have to pay more, but read horror stories about the generic version. Incidently, my pharmacy covers this drug as non formulary but the SR version is formulary. I'm working on that too."

All I wanted to do before taking this was sleep, and when I was up I was grouchy and irritated. I actually like getting up in the morning and enjoy my day. Everyone around me is much happier as well. I tried Cymbalta first and it didn't fit my specific needs, and in fact worsened my depression. There are different medicines for different types of depression. Wellbutrin works on the neurotransmitter dopamine. Dopamine is for motivation and acivating the reward center in the brain. I wouldn't discourage or encourage the use of this drug. It's your doctors job, depending on your depression symptoms, to match you with the best medicine for you. You need not listen to people that say not to try it, everyone is different. This medicine may or may not work for you. Treating depression is not an exact science, due to our lack of knowledge about the brain. Finding the right depression medicine will take trial and error, which can be very frustrating. Stick with it and you will find a medicine that works for you.

General Dysthymia & Sleeping Problems

Pros:
The increased energy levels and motivation have really helped.  The initial euphoric/hyper feelings dissipate quickly but are still enjoyable for the first few days.  Bad thoughts and anxiety tend to pass much more quickly.  Bad moods and sadness are not nearly as ""low"" as they were before.  It makes it much more easy to combat problems instead of dwelling on them.  Improved sleep seems to be a result of the other effects.

Cons:
Constipation is sometimes a problem, but this can be dealt with through proper diet.
I also get more thirsty throughout the day.

Neutral:
Really reduces hunger pangs and overall appetite.  This has been very helpful for losing the weight put on while depressed.  It may not be good for those who are already lean."

One stay was 28 days. I'm a heavy smoker and was given patches in the hosp. The pharmacy was later delivering medication, ie... my patches to the hospital floor one evening. I have never felt such hatred, meanness, urge to actually kill. Not taking wellbutrin but going to start next week. My point is this: I was not just irritable, I was furious, until they got my patch on and all that went away. Maybe what you are calling side effects from the meds are actually withdrawl from the nicotine. I was astounded that I could feel such rage. But as I said, after patch got in to my system all the went away. I see there are two different kinds of wellb. one is ss and one is xl. Could someone tell me the difference. Also I was treated with many drugs, one being cumadin, the blood thinner, for a blood clot that in my leg that had went to my lung six times. I began to notice that when the generic was used, actuallly with all the drugs I had to take, I noticced that the generic drugs were a joke. My doc told me that drug co. have a 10% leway on what they put in meds. That is awful. Generics DO NOT work for me. and i can't afford the name brand. Has anyone else noticed this? and is there any way we can make a complaint to some organization.I did not mean to mislead about being on the medication, but I will be on it this time next week.

Hanging out with a ""bad"" crowd and some drug abuse. He's been in behavioral therapy for 2 years - I finally said, ok, nothing I am doing is working (therapy, life coach skills, summer school).  I was looking into wilderness camp for him too. But, I did not want to put my son on drugs for poor grades.  I did not want him on amphetamine drugs - adamantly. He has been on Wellbutrin 150mg 1x/day for a month.  The change was almost immediate. He wanted to cut his hair shorter - which gave him a real boost when the kids (girls) noticed.  He has gone from a F/D/C student to an A student (it's only the 3rd week of school - so we'll see).  Teachers he has (again) have noticed the change and love it.  He is my son again.   He still has the dumb friends, he still  is smoking uknowwhat I am sure - but it does not seem to be his all emcompassing thought.  He wants to go to the Jr Dance, he is exercising and taking pride in his appearance, he is talking to other kids too at school and noticing the difference in kids.   I am thankful I tried this medicine.  Even though the change is seems drastic - it feels ""normal"" to him, not like he is BAM someone new - just an improved version of him.  My only thought is that after only being on this for one month his Doctor wanted to increase him from 150 to 300mg - I don't understand that - why kick it up (soo much after only a month) when it's fine?  So, I said we'll try the 200mg - which is not timed release - lasts 8 hrs and if my son does not like it - we will go back to 150mg time release.  I guess the 300mg is timed release - but why drink Mountain Dew when a glass of water is really all you need? "

I've been taking 20 mg of Lexapro for 2 years now for anxiety and it helped wonderfully.  But after my Grandmother passed away a little over a month ago, my anxiety attacks were getting the better of me..I made an appointment with my doctor and that's when she wrote me a script for Wellbutrin.  I think it's way too soon to know if it's going to work for me, but I am hopeful!  I am taking the generic, which is nice because it only costs me $4 per month.   "

I was prescribed first Zoloft, then to fight the fatigue caused by it, Wellbutrin XL. As soon as I started taking WB I began to feel more energized, awake at 5.30 am, just like another reviewer, more alive. This was during the winter months. At this time I was also taking a small amount of Zoloft, that was upped a little while later to 200 mg's, at which point I began to feel worse. Than my wellbutrin was upped to 300 mg's,and I began to feel better again. I then ran our of Zoloft completely, and my medication provider failed to reorder it for me, so I remained without it for nearly five weeks. They were wonderful weeks. While the first few days I felt dizzy, I did not feel more emotional or irrational in any way. my doctor, however, insisted I go back on it when it arrived. Sadly. Getting back on that was a rough road. Only two years later, when I was diagnosed with lupus, could I stop. Wellbutrin has been amazing. Yes, it comes with some photosensitive side effects, not so fun for lupus patients, but the good outweighs the bad. Long term, i agree, the effects seem to fade a little. I don't like being without it. It helps another friend with Irritable bowel syndrome, it helped me lose a few pounds. Neither the generic, nor the 150 mg format is a good substitute for the extended release (XL). It has been great and I highly recommend it if you must be on antidepressants.

The insomnia abated after about 3 weeks of treatment and I take a fiber supplement to deal with the constipation. It also abates with time but never completely goes away. Another side effect at firt was a general ""hyper"" feeling but that also wore off after a few weeks. Unlike the SSRIs, Wellbutrin does not make me feel ""drugged” - I feel emotions, good and bad - but the difference I notice while taking the drug is that I tend not to brood or obsess over negative events or ideas, it is easier to let them pass. I think it has also made me more able to open up to talking about my situation because I don’t think I have to reign in my “bad” emotions so tightly as I don’t fear them getting out of control. It is easier to work through them, and talk about them. Wellbutrin by itself is a great help, but by far the most effective treatment for me has been talk therapy. Depression runs in the family. I did not start seeking treatment until age 27 when it became overwhelming  and was affecting my work and relationships. The first course of treatment my physician prescribed were SSRIs (Paxil, Prozac and Zoloft), but I could not tolerate the side effects nausea and drowsiness, but the worst, that although my depression was dampened, so were all my emotions. These side effects never abated. I became even more distant from people I loved and could not function effectively at work because it was difficult to concentrate. I had great doubts about all of the anti-depressants after those experiences, and am skeptical of drug claims and the pharmaceutical industry in general but have to admit that Wellbutrin has been very effective. I know that SSRIs are very effective for many  people - I just wanted to share that portion of my experience because I believed that because they did not work for me, nothing would. I am glad to be proven wrong."

I really like the fact that I don't feel like I need to sleep all the time which I did when I was on Celexa. I also like the way it helps boost my mood and has definitely helped with my sex drive that had been non-existent with Celexa. However, I am waiting for some of the side effects to wear off. My doctor said to give it a few more weeks before I decide if I like it or not. From day two I have been dizzy. It is better now than it was, but still feeling it. I also have been very nauseas and I have had a mild headache, kinda feels like a sinus headache. I also have had hot flashes and night sweats and my ADHD is actually worse. I find that odd since this drug can also be taken for ADHD. 
If the side effects fade I am all for this medicine, but if they don't there is no way I can keep taking it. I have also had some trouble sleeping, but as long as I take at least half of my dose of Neuratin and Buspar a few hours before bed I am fine. If I forget to take it early I can't take it at all because I need 12 hours before getting up to get those two out of my system or I can't find it hard to wake up on time. I'm gonna give it one more week and if the side effects don't fade it is back to the doc for our next trial and error run."

2251$Condition: Stop Smoking$5/26/2010 8:46:58 PM$Reviewer: JustSayNO, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$4$3$I use to take Wellbutrin many years ago for depression. This was before they came out with the SR and XL. You had to take it using a starter kit that had a certain dosage for each day. Side effects were minimal for me except for severe upset stomach for the initial 2 to 3 weeks. It eventually subsided. My doctor said that side effect is rare. Well NOT 4 me. My doctor wrote me a prescription for XL 300 the other day to help me stop smoking. Im assuming the extended release formula replaces the need for the gradual starter kit. I sure hope so otherwise taking 300mg from the get go may be intolerable for my digestive system. It worked pretty well for my depression but what I remember most was the effect it had on reducing my smoking. Cigs tasted like sucking on molded burnt logs. I quit the medication because at that time I really wanted to enjoy my cigarettes again. Idiot I know. Not this time though. Those old molded burnt logs are going to be thrown out never to return. I suggest this medicine for smoking cessation over that new Cymbalta stuff. It has the same indications at about a tenth of the price. Cimbalta is just ripping people off. I really doubt it affects the brain much differently than does Wellbutrin. Especially when only taken for a short period. Wellbutrin is indicated for smoking cessation. If it was harmful to people who are not depressed I doubt that this purpose would be listed as one of the uses. If I could afford the Cimbalta I'd try it instead just to see how it compares for me versus Wellbutrin in altering the taste of cigarettes. My guess is Cymbalta does not work as well as Wellbutrin for this purpose. It was marketed differently probably due to the stigma some have for taking anti-depressants. It will interesting to see what the effects,if any,while taking when not depressed. It may have the effects of ecstacy...lol doubtful but it would make for quite an experience. Probably would not curb my craving for a cigarette. Will post results later

2264$Condition: Depression$5/6/2010 2:50:27 PM$Reviewer: Great Mom , 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$I started taking this Welbutrin 2 months ago. At 30 years of age, I never in my wildest dreams thought I would need such a medication.  But after starting a family, work and daily activities, I found myself overwhelmed and it was difficult to deal with people and situations. It was enough for me to consult with a doctor and see what was out there to help. My symptoms in plain english included, not wanting to be around friends or functions that normally I would attend, loss of interest at work, easily distracted by anything, sleepless nights, picking at my husband over every little thing (which was causing problems.  But since I've been taking this medicine my relationships with people overall have improved dramatically, I have more energy and I am less of an emotional eater.  I could go on and on.  I love this medication and I'm a happier person!

It started with severe headaches, fuzzy thoughts and just the general feeling of being uncomfortable. Last Thursday I started taking it twice a day and have been in bed for the last three days with such severe muscle aches and off and on temperature with ringing in one ear.  I even had to pull over when driving home from work on Friday because I kept feeling ""blackness"".  I am also a runner and since starting this medication, my legs have felt heavy and sore to the bone, not even able to finish a short training session.  I have not taken any more of the medication since this happened and am going to the doctor this morning!  I am sure that she will say it is a virus, but I know that is definitely was the Wellbutrin because the side effects were immediate. Has anyone else had these side effects?"

I took this drug when I was 20 turning 21, I quit taking the drug b/c I had bad side-effects (I figured out the only time I had those side-effects was when I was drinking alcohol) recently I realized I had a serious alcohol-abuse problem, I joined the Fellowship of Alcoholics Anonymous and I have been sober for 5 months. When working with my Psychiatrist in an attempt to control my ADHD (he wanted to work in my Alcohol Abuse) I asked him if I could try Wellbutrin again.  I have only been taking it this go around, for less than a week, I take Wellbutrin in addition to Trazadone (for sleep) Lexapro (my opinion the BEST anti-depressant) Adderall (for ADHD), one of the 'benefits' I am receiving from Wellbutrin is the cessation my my nicotine cravings! The other 'benefits' I am experiencing: more 'real' energy (not too much) I am able to get through the day without PRAYING I can go to bed when I get home at 6pm, also I can THINK much more clearly, I have patience now (I didn't realize I wasn't very patient before), I have a reasonable appetite during the day (Adderall suppresses appetite) I am calm and I cry a lot less than before :)

I'm not sure about this drug yet. I was taking 150 mg SR twice a day for 2 months and really felt not difference.  Previously I was taking prozac for about 4 months which helped my mood but left me feeling so tired and lethargic; therefore I switched.  Now I'm taking Wellbutrin XL 300mg (for one week)  and still have only felt little relief.  The worst side effect for me is abdominal pain.  Day 2 of taking the new dose I started feeling bad stomach pain.  Still has not got better but I'm trying to wait it out to see if it will help my mood.

I slowly switched from Effexor to Wellbutrin, I take 400mg in the morning now, then added Xanax .25 at night for anxiety. The effect was startling - in a few days, I hate much more energy and motivation. I used to have to take naps at work at lunchtime because I felt like I was going to almost faint - at least 2-3 times a week. I have done that for 10 minutes once in 2 years. I was able to do 5 years of taxes that I was too tired to tackle before, and I can function much better in general now. Made a huge difference in my life, night and day. Wellbutrin affects dopamine levels much more than most of the SSRI's, I believe that's the reason. I am a recovering alcoholic (26 years sober), and drinking affects dopamine too, so I can see why Wellbutrin works for me.

Started at 150 for about 3 weeks and then went to 300 for over a week now. I do not suffer from anxiety and i am not sure how this would ever be a medication for the treatment of anxiety ? It would seem to me that this medication could very well increase anxiety for those who have anxiety related issues. 
What it has done for me : Got me out of bed instead of sleeping all day for no real reason i could think of . It jump-started me so to speak. I have way more get up and go along with reduced anger,i got away from this senseless sadness,constant rehashing issues i have no control over and this is what i should be.
Hope this continues for me. I get my 6 ,7 or 8 hours of sleep and i am ready to go.I really have nothing negative to say at this point for me."

My personal experience with this drug was positive. I did experience constipation however, and this is easily prevented by adding TWO apples to your daily food intake and drinking at least 1 ounce of water, for every 2 pounds of body weight. I will actually be looking to go back on this anti-depressant again soon as I am in the middle of divorce and things are starting to overwhelm me. But I do not feel like I ""need"" it.

The side effects are annoying (get less sleep now, increased libido, possible increase in anxiety) and really became noticeable at 300mg. It hasn't hosed me over like just about every other anti-depressant I have taken (and I've tried a couple dozen at this point) so it's the one I have to settle for. I'm taking the SR version in case my IBS acts up. To the person that asked about taking all of the SR's at once, they release the medicine over a 12 hour period, so I have to wonder about that. I spread mine out (loosely every eight hours). On the other hand, having a higher dose during the day may be a good thing. Sounds like you should ask your doctor about this.

It stabilizes my mood swings effectively. However, my insurance company decided to switch me to generic form of Wellbutrin. I assumed it was working for me until I hit bottom and was so out of control I didn't know what to do. I wasn't in therapy at the time. My GP was continuing the prescriptions and follow up with me after I moved away from my therapist. My GP recognized that I was in trouble during a routine exam and sent me immediately to a therapist she highly recommended. This therapist works closely with a psychiatrist that I am now seeing.  She recognized that the problem was the generic form of Wellbutrin (I wasn't taking Lamictal at that time).  I read several reviews by patients experiencing the same problem, with the same symptoms, which I found on the internet. I owe my life to these doctors for recognizing the problem and switching me back to Brand Wellbutrin XL.  My insurance company still won't cover the Brand but insists on the generic even though my doctors have explained the problem and insisted that I take the Brand name drug. I have to pay full price for Wellbutrin or suffer the dire consequences.  I have now ordered the drug from a reputable pharmacy in Canada at a lower price.

Yesterday, I walked out of the supermarket without paying something, for I forgot that I was holding it in my hands. Thankfully, I was not accused of shoplifting. I realized that it was in my hand when I got home. Although it works great in all other respects, it seems like a very expensive price to pay. I am calling my doctor tomorrow.

I tried everything under the sun to help my severe anxiety disorder and once I found this, my life has changed for the best. I can do my daily activities without wanting to stay in bed and worry about missing the things I needed to stay in for. I handle my emotions better and do not constantly stress myself over the littlest things. This medication is my life saver! TRY IT! 

Only side effect was nausea for the first month or so....but it was worth it! And if you forget a dose, it is not the end of the world. Just take it the next day as scheduled!

I love you Wellbutrin XL!"

My first episode of depression was treated with Wellbutrin and the medication was very effective.  Went off when planning to become pregnant. Recently returned to using Wellbutrin, orginally at 150mg which wasn't as effective as the 300mg dose. Side effects have included: nausea, weight loss, poor appetite, occasional headaches. Although I initially lost weight due to the depression I now have to really force myself to eat and find myself going hours without food only to feel terrible due to low blood sugar levels. Also noticed some increase in anxiety symptoms. I am considering going back to the 150mg dosage.  I discovered that adding SAMe supplements have helped as well.

My ""mild"" depression includes a general feeling of lethargy, difficulty motivating myself to do simple things, feeling overwhelmed with the thought of completing simple tasks.  I was functioning in life but at a  lower level.  Anyway onto the med review:  MD prescribed 100 mg 1x a day and then told to work up to 200 mg 1x a day after a week.  First week at 100 mg....tons of headaches, crazy dehydration, wierd flighty feeling, nauseus, lack of appetite.  I convinced myself to stick with it at uped my dose.  Experienced 4 days of the worst headaches of my life.  I had to quit completely b/c I couldn't function.  Waited a week and began 100 mg once a day again and this time no headaches,  I am sticking with my low dose since it seems to give me the extra lift I need.  I don't feel medicated or foggy.  The biggest thing to disappear was the feeling of being overwhelmed.  I feel like a weight was lifted off my shoulders.  As for side effects now...I have a tendency to get dehydrated more quickly when on the meds so I have to really drink alot of water.  If I don't hydrate the headaches follow.  Initially my appetite completely disappeared.  Now it's less but not significantly.  This med does seem to reduce cravings in general.  I am not a drinker but had a couple drinks (despite my better judgement) on NY's Eve.  The next day or 2 I felt like the meds weren't working.....felt lethargic, just down.  Definately not worth the drinks of Champagne so I'll abstain 100% for now.  I am at a much lower dosage then is prescribed for most people but it works for me.   Main con i that I do notice that I can become agitated quicker.  I am usually the most laid back person, almost too laid back.  So for me it's not a big deal but I wouldn't recommend this med to anyone who has a tendency to anger easily or experiences anxiety."

I took the 2 a day version for 5 months before not being able to stand the headaches anymore.  I also felt very jittery the first week or so.  I recently switched to the extended release medication and my headaches are gone!  My doctor said that maybe the large dose twice a day was like a fire that then burned out over & over.  I would definitely recommend the extended version of this drug.  In the past I had taken zoloft and I did feel great.  A little too great.  I gained 30 lbs over 6 months and had NO libido.  And I couldn't sleep at night to boot!  I did love how I felt, but I had to sleep and I didn't want to take a medication to sleep every night on top of the zoloft.  I like the welbutrin better for me because it only lessened my symptoms enough to be able to wrap my head around the issues in my life that were completely overwhelming me.  It didn't mask the problems as I felt the zoloft did.  Only helped me feel like I could compartmentalize them and start to deal with them.  Definitely make your doctor give you the extended release!

I hate to think that drugs (or alcohol for that matter) are the answer, but clearly, Wellbutrin (buproprion) is an effective adjunct to my transition toward totally clean living.

My overall experience has been good, especially in the beginning. However, after insurance forced me to start using the generic, I have found it to be less effective than the original formula. I'm thinking about going back to brand name even though I have to pay for it. I hope it's the generic formula and not due to tolerance build up that is causing the waning effects.

I have been on the generic brand of Wellbutrin XL 150mg for 6 weeks now, and feel ""better"" overall (taking med for chronic depression/anxiety) and not having the severe mood swings, nor the usual emotional outburts and crying spells that I used to.  I feel more focused and in control...finally getting myself back and able to smile.  I have completely stopped smoking cold turkey, which was not initially intended, but a definite benefit. I have not had any side effects, except some weight loss due to appetite control, which is also a welcome benefit. I went up to 300mg after 4 weeks, but found it to make me very irritable, so I came back down to 150mg. After visiting my doctor, we decided to add 10mg of the generic Prozac to my med regimen, since I felt that I was very ""indifferent"" and not really finding the ""joy"" in things.  Today was the first day on Prozac...felt lots of energy and remain very optimistic.  Good luck everyone.  You're not alone:)"

I don't want to be on medication for a long time so I have to make a committment to myself to continue the counseling after I stop the pill.

It countered wonderfully the Paxil I was co-currently taking.  I had not until adding Wellbutrin been able to orgasm in less than 35 minutes!

They also caused weight gain and sexual disfunction. I was weaned off of them with a lot of withdrawl symptoms. About 8 years ago I was on wellbutrin. I remembered how much better it was than the others. When I felt that things were getting bad again I asked my Dr if he could try me back on that. I immediately had more energy, better attentin span, weight loss and better sex. I am only taking half the dose prescribed, 150mg in the morning. I am now at a plateau, so I may begin taking my second dose of 150 mg early afternoon. The only side effects are slight hand tremors, some irritability and my heart races especially if I have a few drinks. Not enough side effects to give it up. Really, if the other drugs you are taking make you feel lifeless, ask your Dr to try this. When I went off this the first time I had way less withdrawl sickness than the others.

I went to a phycologist who diagnosed me with the PTSS, and said that I should see about getting medication for that..I ignored him, and my out look on life was getting worse steadily. My girl friend was beginning to back away from me. I had many and thoughts about ending all of the pain. I was convinced that It wouldn't be hard to do and that would end the mental torment. My girl friend finally talked me into talking to my GP about this condition, and I did. He prescribed Wellbutrin 300xl. Withing a week I felt like a new person. I was still was having the anger issue, but the depression was gone and I wasn't interested in ending it all.  This is now 4 years later and wellbutrin is still doing it's thing. I did try others (Ambilify, Cymbalta, Zolof) and they were all horrible. They ruined sex, but the Wellbutrin is a Godsend in that department.  I understand that Wellbutrin isn't the same for everyone, but this has been my experience.

I have BP and had an episode of severe depression that lasted several months last year. Before that, my episodes were manic except for a depressive episode when I was sixteen. The mania is not as severe or as lengthy as it was in my late teens and early/middle twenties so Lamictal alone has been enough to keep me stable at this point. After 10 weeks on Wellbutrin I finally started to crawl out of the dark pit. My current regimine is 300 Lamical at night and 300 Wellbutrin XL in the morning. The Wellbutrin causes ringing in the ears. I don't notice it too much until I sit down at the end of the day to relax (I have two small children). I enjoy reading, but am distracted too much by the ringing to concentrate. I am tolerating it because Wellbutrin has worked so well for my depression. Also, I had been on a generic and my Pharmacy switched to another generic brand and it really messed me up. I was very anxious (I don't suffer normally), confused, dizzy and had a strong metallic taste. My doc said that she's had other similar complaints and recommended switching to the name brand. I did and since then have been back to as close to normal as I'll ever get LOL:) Also, to all those suffering from sleep problems and irritability, do you drink caffeine? I'm very sensitive to it and have been off of it for six years. On occassion I will ""splurge"" and have a sweet tea or Dr. Pepper at a resturant, but then I'm very jittery, irritable, hyper and VERY chatty. When I finally go to bed (2-3 am) I wake up often which impacts my mood and concentration the next day...vicious cycle, so I stay away from it."

I have been medicatited most of the last 10 years. I was perscribed Welbutrin, and Celexa to take place of prozac, which hasn't really been effective for 2 years.I also started taking Clonopin 6 months ago, .5mg 1 or 2 a day. The Clp I like it seems to really help calm me. I take it around 1 pm before my kids come home from school! My primary care dr. retired so my new dr wasn't comfortable refilling the clonopin because it can be addictive! Who cares if I'm taking it everyday anyway? So I go see a real phsyc. dr. f9or help. The first 2 days I was very tense and jumpy had hot flashes. After that the migrain hit. I have suffered from headaches in the past so didn't relate it to the meds for a couple days. But after 4 days of severe pain in the top of my head, I spoke to my Dr. who said a small percent of people will experience migrain from the Wb. The next morning I had an ice pack on my neck at six am. I took only the Celexa that day and realized around 11am my headache was almost gone! I still had tension and restlessness dry mouth. Today I didn't take anything until about 11 am I took 1/2 clonopin to take the edge off. I am actually feeling good today. I slept better last night. That helped alot! I see him in one week, during that time I will try go solo as much as possible. (I have my clonopin if I get too out of hand!) Then I will ask my dr to try effexor xl. I was on this for 5 years before I got pregnant with my youngest. I did very well after the 1st couple weeks of side effects. Hope this helps someone. I know I go to the reviews to see how pills effect different people. It helps. We all have a different chemistry and a single goal in common...TO FEEL GOOD!

It is an extended release version of the drug which should help eliminate the need to take it more than once a day.  Anyway, my best advice to anyone with depression and/or bi-polar disorder is to try any meds that are offered or are available.  It took a while to find the medications that worked for me.  Don't be worried about taking more than one drug either, if you need to.  I have been taking Wellbutrin XL for 3 1/2 YEARS.  I am taking 450 mg and have been for most of that time period.  I have had excellent results on this med, and have had no side effects at all, ever, nor have I had any significant weight gain.  This medicine has worked wonderful for ME.  I have bi-polar disorder; therefore I also take Lamictal 400 mg, and Seroquel 100 mg.  This is the ""cocktail"" of meds that have worked for me.  Medicine affects everyone differently.  Don't think that just because one person had serious side effects that you will also.  This medicine may be just what you need.  Sometimes you have to trust the doctor more than the reviewers.  The doctors know what the side effects may be.  They are in no way trying to hurt you!  They are trying to help you the only way they know how!  Good luck and God bless you!  There is hope, just don't give up!"

Before taking Wellbutrin, I wasn't a depressed person, but it caused me to become suicidal and ended up overdosing and was hospitalized due to severe seizures.  I was diagnosed in my early 20s with clinical depression, and was put on Wellbutrin XL again to treat it.  It made a major difference in the first 2 months while on it, but after that it became useless and I became more suicidal than ever.  My appetite was very off while on this medication - I could go for two days without feeling hungry and would literally have to force myself to eat.  My anxiety worsened on the medication as well.  I just switched to Zoloft today. Hopefully that will help!

Good progress untill 10 days ago.
Then I started feeling like I hit a plateau.

The mood boost would start wearing-off in the early afternoon.
Anxiety was starting to ramp-up.

Should I ask my doctor to increase WB & perhaps suppliment with something like Lexapro?"

2420$Condition: Depression$10/2/2009 9:33:06 AM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $5$5$5$I had suffered from depression for years before I started taking Wellbutrin.  It has made a major positive difference in my life in the way I handle things; I am able to think much more clearly and rationally.  For the first few years I combined the medication with therapy.  I was taking 225 mg when I started and have had to increase it once to 300 mg/ day.  I currently take the Wellbutrin 300 XL.  Word of caution on the generic version of Wellbutrin 300 XL - I tried it when it was approved and found after a few months that I was becoming depressed again.  The generic did not work for me; the tablet may have the same amount of medication but the packing (what makes up the rest of the pill)is completely different than the brand name.  For me it seemed like instead of medication being steadily administered to my system throughout the day it hit all at once, thus the return of the depression.  I was hoping to be able to save some money with the generic but it is worth it to me to take the brand name.

I had to stop it because it made my depression worse. I felt hopeless and started having suicidal thoughts. I was tired all the time and I felt like all I wanted to do was sleep. It took so much energy to get up and do ANYTHING that it like I was fighting with my inner stubborn child to get anything done. Including going to the bathroom. My mind felt like I was in a fog bubble and I couldn't think. I had to concentrate very hard about just basic things. I became cranky, irritable and downright ridiculously rude. Anything that I thought fell right out of my mouth no matter what it was. I couldn't stand being around me... I know no one else did either. Having two children that I homeschool, I couldn't stay on the medicine. I decided that mild depression was better than being psychotic and on the verge of catatonic.

I took 75 mg/day, and it gave me a lot of energy, focus, attention span. However, caused anxiety and the worst symptom was severe hair loss.  The first time I tried it, I noticed the hair loss after 2 weeks.  I stopped taking it for about 6 months.  Then, I gave it another try, thinking maybe it wasn't the Wellbutrin.  As soon as I started taking it again, my hair started coming out by the handfuls, right about 1.5 weeks into taking it.

When the effects of that started to wane I went to a doctor that prescribed Wellbutrin for me. I immediately received outstanding help from this drug. For the first time since I was a child I felt like a ""normal"" person. It helped with every facet of The Monster, Depression. I have been taking this drug for twenty years and I will never give it up. It and the doctor who prescribed it gave me my life back. It also helps somewhat with Fibromyalgia and CFIDS. It once   helped to keep me awake. I no longer get that benefit from the drug and am taking Provigil to try to remain alert.

I've been taking Wellbutrin XL for over 4 years. I also was taking Cymbalta (didn't notice any help from that drug), but stopped due to the perceived ineffectiveness over 6 months ago with no negative effects. WB however seemed to help level out my depression. Instead of the very deep lows they became less severe over time until my mood was manageable. When I began taking WB I immediately noticed a decrease in appetite and lost several pounds right away. In time my appetite came back and have gained the weight back. It also helped with my cravings for habits I had stopped years ago, e.g., smoking, drinking, drugs, etc. If I wanted to stop smoking, drinking or drugs I would HIGHLY recommend WB as an adjunct therapy. I see why ZYBAN is prescribed for smoking cessation! I have tried weening back to 150mg from the 300mg dose I take daily before bed, but noticed mood changes within a week so I went back to 300mg, not wanting to fix it if it wasn't broken. It seems as though I may have to take something for the rest of my life as I have been a lifetime depression sufferer. The only side effect I suffer from is that I think it contributes to sexual dysfunction, but depression itself could be the main culprit. There is no free lunch with any medication. Your mileage may vary ;-).

2468$Condition: Other$8/7/2009 9:18:07 PM$Reviewer: 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$This drug drastically improved my quality of life. Though I do not have a formal dx of MDD, I suffered from both depression and fatigue- not sure if it was fatigue as a symptom of depression, or that I was depressed because I was fatigued all the time post mono.  In any case, the Wellbutrin XL took care of both of them. In my experience having tried all three, the brand is the best, then the generic buproprion, and BY FAR THE WORST is the generic budeprion-HORRIBLE headaches.  Right now I have been taking 300mg of the generic buproprion for about a year because the brand got too expensive, even with insurance.  While on the brand drug, I lost about 10-15lbs but since have gained it back (not sure if it is related to swtiching from the brand to generic).  Side effects I experienced/still experience include a headache the first week on it, constipation the first week on it, and for the two years I have taken it I have had increased eye sensitivity to sunlight.  As a patient taking it and a registered nurse, I highly recommend this drug for patients experiencing depression with fatigue, especially if SSRI's increased your feeling of fatigue.

2482$Condition: Depression$7/24/2009 3:46:23 AM$Reviewer: Kathy O, 55-64 Female  (Patient) $5$5$5$"I have suffered from depression most of my life.  In my early 20’s I started see a psychiatrist.  I received talk therapy as well as antidepressants’ throughout my life.  I have been off & on Prozac for the past 20 years.  For nearly two years, I have had trouble with sleeping too much (anywhere from 12 to 20 hours a night).  When I saw my regular doctor, she suggested increasing my Prozac to 40mg & said I should expect to stay on it for the rest of my life (I am 63).  With no improvement she added Effexor (75mg).  It didn’t seem to improve the sleeping or depression.  Besides the excessive sleeping, I also felt like crying all the time; found no joy in life; had no energy; & no motivation to do anything (other than what was absolutely necessary ).  I went to a psychiatrist  and he decreased the Effexor  (37.5mg).  With still no improvement, he stopped the Effexor and started me on Wellbutrin (300mg).  Within about three weeks I felt like a “normal” person.  I would wake before the alarm would ring, had more energy and felt not so hopeless. I hadn’t felt like this in a long time.  The change lasted about two months.   After he wrote the next prescription for Budeprion XL (300mg), which he said was cheaper.  I started to feel like I was going back to my old pattern of sleeping too much (not as bad as before but still too much) and not as much energy as with Wellbutrin..  I am sad to say I did not experience any weight loss with either the Wellbutrin or the generic.  While taking the generic, I had some adverse effects which include: dry mouth; tremors of the hands; increase in resting heart rate (85+ per minute); trouble keeping my balance and some hair loss.  When I see the psychiatrist in a month, I plan on having write a prescription for Wellbutrin, not the generic.  It is worth the extra money.

It has really helped me out in so many ways.  I have Muscular Dystrophty (FSH type).  Have been markidly depressed for about 6 years.  Nothing has worked, until I actually asked.. to try Wellbutrin.  Wellbutrin has changed my life.  It has definatly increased quality of life, over quanity of life.  Makes dealing with my everyday disease more at ease, with my physical weakness, and mental tiredness.  And what I like about it is, is that it doesn't make you feel ""high"" or ""euphoria"", well, to me anyways, but you just... feel good.  And that is quality of life to me."

2488$Condition: Other$7/18/2009 5:26:06 PM$Reviewer: ashleyamore, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $2$2$3$I just began [this will be day 4] my treatment with wellbutrin. I tried to get an appointment with a psychiatrist only to be told that I couldn't be seen until the middle of august. [almost a full month from then]. I already had been suffering from severe daytime anxiety, but one night I awoke with what I would later find out was a nocturnal panic attack. This was very scary for me, as I thought it could've been sleep apnea, and my nighttime panic attacks were MUCH worse than my daytime ones, which is saying something. My heart would race, beat out my chest, I would shake, become disoriented and dizzy, and my chest would tighten up. My breathing would become very labored. This happened to me every night for over a week before I broke down and went to my PCP. He prescribed me wellbutrin 150 mg once a day for a week, to be increased to two a day if I don't see results. I also have bipolar disorder, which I'm not sure if my PCP knew.  Anyway, my side effects were NOT pleasant. For the first three days I was so restless I felt like I was going to claw my own skin off. I had TONS of energy. My nighttime panic attacks worsened. I felt like I was on coke. [LITERALLY]. I couldn't stop pacing, and my heart was racing. I couldn't sleep. I took my medication at 8pm as I'm generally a night owl, figuring this would be ample time for my body to adjust to the medication before sleep. I was up every day for 3 days until 6 am. Last night was the first day so far that I felt only mild symptoms. I was twitchy but able to sleep at my normal time [around 1 am]....It makes me somewhat apathetic. But once I would take the medicine during the first three or so days of treatment, let me tell you, it was HELL. I seriously considered stopping the medication because my anxiety was driving me crazy. I do have the jaw clenching still. If you can stick it out through the temporary hell, its not so bad for my mood. STAY CALM ON THIS MEDICINE- IT MAKES PANIC ATTACKS MUCH WORSE DURING THE FIRSTDAYS

At times, I did struggle and still struggle with suicidal thoughts but that has gotten better as I have gotten older. I did have one period of time where it seemed that the Wellbutrin was loosing its effectiveness. I was weaned off of it and I tried several other antidepressants but none worked as well. I ended up going back on the Wellbutrin and for a short time, was given another medication with it. I am now taking only Wellbutrin and it is once again working well for me most of the time.

Within a day I had nausea, felt like throwing up, headaches, insomnia, and confusion.  Five days after starting, I woke up 5:30 am with such a severe headache I could hardly move, which was followed by severe nausea- my husband got a waste basket for me just in case because I could not move.  I had really bad chest pains added to this, and I counted the minutes till my doctors office opened at 8:00 am.  I had read that some people had more severe side effects with the generic version.  The active ingredient is the same amount in both, but the other components are different, causing some people to react differently.  I wanted to be prescribed Wellbutrin, not the generic, and within a day, most of the symptoms had gone.  What a relief.  It has been mostly a good change- I feel more calm, less anxious, and able to concentrate more, I feel almost ""normal"", but I still have some agitation and sometimes cry at small things, but do not feel depressed, if that makes any sense.  It usually only lasts a few minutes.  I think it would be beneficial to add another medication to this to maximize my results."

And I agained 4 lbs in a week! The opposite of what I wanted to happen. Hopefully it will change and go the other way. No sexual side effects except that it is better!  I do have a range of emotions every day though from being confident and secure to being totally insecure and emotional. This too, I hope will pass soon.

After taking it I feel normal again. I know it works becuase if I miss a few pills the same feelings come back until I start taking the pills regularly again. They seem to have a few day delay. Also, my pharmacy gave me the generic version one time so I thought what the heck and decided it wasn't a big deal, but I was wrong. It made my feel like I wasn't taking anything at all and the old feelings were back. After that I made sure my pharmacy always gave me the name brand. This drug really works for me.

I read an article about some having the same problem so tomorrow I'm back to wellbutrin.  Also it's common to need another medication with this to combat what I call compulsive hyper nastiness.  Everyone is different to what brand/dosage/combination works for them and requires alot of patience.  If you don't feel your dr is listening to you when you're not feeling well, move on to another dr. Just like meds, some drs are better than others.  :)

I have had other mental health issues other than depression for which my doctors prescribed Wellbutrin.

Turned out that I had bipolar type II.

Regardless, at the times I would go off of Wellbutrin, I would get into addictive habits like excess drinking and other unsavory vices.

Now, I don't think Wellbutrin is all that effective since I take other drugs that address the underlying issues I have with the bipolar and ADHD.

I am taking 300mg per day.  The Effexor made me so tired I was unable to function.  While Wellbutrin has reduced my fatigue, I have become very agitated and angry.  I am so mean and say awful things to people.  It has not helped at all with my depression.  In fact, my depression is worse.  On Effexor XR, I never cried or felt like crying.  On Wellbutrin I cry during commercials.  This medication does not work for me at all.  My doctor wants me to switch to Lexapro.

It took a while for the medicine to take full effect. The first 2 months, I was happy, sometimes a little too happy.  Now it has evened out.  It does make me hyper and at times very aggresive but I know it is just the medicine and I can keep it in check.  I haven't gained any weight either.  The only negative thing I can say about it is if I take too much of this medicine, I feel very irratated. I have to space 2 150mg XL at least 4 hours apart. I can't take one 300 mg XL at one time.

I was prescribed 150mg, but after 5 days I had to get off.  I started to get increasingly shaky and I got a bad sore throat and dry mouth.  I didn't sleep for like 2 days, and I started to act kind of weird - like I blew everything out of proportion.  I also started to get nauseous and have headaches.  Anyway, the evening of the 5th day of being on Wellbutrin, I ended up having my first ever panic attack...the night before a final.  It was horrible - it was one of the worst nights of my life.  Thankfully I was able to get a hold of my psychiatrist who was able to get my final rescheduled - I know for a fact I would not have been in any shape to take it the next day.   

Anyway, I'm disappointed Wellbutrin didn't work for me.  I realize that it helps a lot of people, but if you start to get these types of anxiety/mood symptoms, go off before it gets any worse - because it will, and it's not fun.  "
2546$Condition: Other$5/14/2009 9:15:26 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $1$1$5$I was put on Wellbutrin XL 150 for complaints of anxiousness associated with job related stress.  I was on Lexapro 5 mg which assisted me in not worrying about how I would manage to complete all the tasks of my demanding job each day.  However, the Lexapro gave me a zero sex drive.  At 30 years old, I was not comfortable with that. In the first week, I took 2.5 mg of Lexapro while starting Wellbutrin XL at the recommendation of my doctor.  The first week I did not have any problems, but by the second week, I began having racing feelings, hot flashes, chills, belly pain, and what seemed to be an increased heartbeat and off vision.  Additionally, I felt agitated and by week three, was crying off and on for no reason.  After four weeks of being on Wellbutrin XL (3 weeks of just Wellbutrin XL by itself since I was still taking Lexapro in the first week), I contacted my doctor, who as luck would have it, is on maternity leave now.  I attempted to taper every other day for a few days, but I felt worse on the day I took the drug versus the day I skipped.  I am now 12 days off Wellbutrin without tapering.  Nevertheless, I am still having hot flashes off and on and a racing heartbeat feeling.  It is not as bad as when I was taking the medication every day, but I still do not feel myself.  If you have just a bit of anxiety about how you can manage all that is required in a job which lots of responsibility and long hours, I would not recommend starting this drug.  I do not have depression,  yet most of what I am reading seems to indicate that people who need an extra push to get out of bed are the people that find this medicine useful.

I felt so much better on it but as of now, I am 40 lbs heavier. I have maintained the same weight for like past couple years prior to taking Zoloft and now I cannot stop gaining. It averages about 10 lbs a year and changes in diet and increases in exercise did nothing for me. I got frustrated and depressed about myself so I called my PCP and told him I wanted to try wellbutrin xl, because I heard its does the same thing and often causes people to lose weight rather than gain. I have been taking the generic Buproprion SR now for a little over a month and I am completely miserable. Apparently, people who have anxiety are not supposed to take this drug because it only treats depression and a side effect of it is an increase in anxiety. I have been experiencing loss of appetite but that come with nausea and queasiness-- I feel like I am pregnant (and I am not!). My head feels like its out of whack and I cant really describe the way that it messes with my vision and hearing without sounding like a whack job. My doctor should have known that this drug, with is an SNRI will not help me the way an SSRI does because of my anxiety. This past weekend I graduated college-- an important part of my life-- and I felt incredibly hostile and would go from screaming at my friends and family to bawling my eyes out in 2.5 secs. Thanks, doc. I am glad that I have google and WebMD to tell me what I should/should not take, because he apparently cannot.

I had constant headache & unending nausea - and I've only been taking it for about a week.  I haven't taken it in for two days now and I am still having horrible stomach problems and dizziness.  The only good thing so far is that I am not smoking as much, only about 2 or 3 cigarettes a day from smoking about a pack a day. Guess I will be going back to the doctor very soon for something else. I wish there was an easier way of finding a medication that worked. I feel like a lab rat going through all these different medicines! I wish everyone the best of luck with finding the medicine(s) that work for you.

My mood doesn't flip at the slightest negative event and one annoying thing no longer ruins an entire day for me. I can think clearly and positively without losing my ability to be upset when there is a reason to be. (nothing like showing up to a funeral grinning and cracking jokes because you can't feel sad.) I don't have issues with getting up in the morning (well not ones that I didn't have long before the bipolar set in. I am not a morning person.) and I don't have the issues of manic episodes where I can't sleep until I have to be medicated into unconsciousness. I no longer constantly sit at my desk with the lights off holding a box cutter and staring at it for hours or go off on screaming rants about things that are trivial. I feel in control of myself and my actions as opposed to the constant feeling of being out of control; an observer in my own self destruction. This is what it does for me. Considering that we are all complex creatures of finely balanced chemicals it may not for you but that doesn't mean there isn't something that can help you regain control of your life. Take time with your physician to figure out what is right for you. And be picky it's your life if something isn't working go back to your doctor and try something else don't torture yourself and end up even worse.

The wellbutrin itself worked great, I had loads of energy and did not experience any of the side effects. However, since I've switched to the buprpion,(due to insurance prefering everyone use Generic),I have tried 3 other antidepressants to try to help with the side effects. My mood has changed dramatically for the worse, no energy, headaches or migraines at least 3 times a week, have not even wanted to quit smoking, and now I am at the point of just staying alone, not want to join in family functions or talk to my closest friends. I highly recommend that anyone taking Bupropion XL talk to their physician about writing a letter of referal for the name brand Wellbutrin XL to the insurance company because the Generic is not the same and does not have the equality as the Wellbutrin.

In December I began taking the 300mg XL version.  It helped me tremendously.  I had so much energy and motivation to do things.  It was a generic.  In March I had to switch my pharmacy so they gave me a different generic.  It was made by Watson.  I started getting really tired all the time.  I was constantly angry with people for no good reason and also seemed to be obbsessive compulsive.  There were also many physical side effects also.  I finally realized it was the medicine and stopped it immediately.  I began feeling so much better within 24 hours.  I can't believe the difference in these generics.  Please pay close attention to how you begin feeling when you take these.  I seriously think I would have become suicidal if I had not quit and I have never felt that way before.  If it's not working for you go to your doctor and try something else because these medicines can really change your entire personality.

However, I experienced a paradoxical reaction to the medicine about 48 hours after first use.  Interestingly, the first time I used it, I felt better.  Not the next... I felt like I wanted to die.  I have had depression most of my life, and this beat everything I have ever felt (this was a -1 dose- effect, btw).  I quit taking it immediately and tossed it in the trash.  I had an appointment with my psychiatrist the next day, and told him all about it.  Normally, a doctor would say not to miss a dose (which I did by not taking it the next morning) without asking, but mine said he was glad I got off it.  Desipramine works better for me.

Not suggesting that this is a poor drug; I'm sure it's great for many people.  However, believe it when they say it can have side effects or make you feel worse..."

Paid attention to my reactions after a.m. dose only and then with noon dose.  There appears to be a cumulative negative effect, producing more irrational impatience.  I'm scared; will discuss w/psych after having read generic reviews and Wellbutrin reviews.  I  do not normally have bad reactions to any kinds of medication.  NB: the generic medication seemed to work w/ Lexapro for a year. I've been on the genric Budeprion SR for two months. I'll ask to switch to the Wellbutrin and write back.  I've been retired about a year--I should be relaxed.

2576$Condition: Depression$4/13/2009 3:15:54 PM$Reviewer: LiveAndLearn, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$I took this medication about 3 wks for depression. In that time I went from being my easy going sweet self to a witch on wheels. It was bad enough for my whole family to sit me down. I was later diagonsed with bi-polar due to extremely stressful conditions. I'm not sure if this medication exaserbated that problem since at the time it had gone undiagnosed. I would recommend before starting anything for depression you make sure that's all you're dealing with.

2580$Condition: Depression$4/7/2009 11:02:49 AM$Reviewer: lazybonz,  Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$I have been on wellbutrin for 15 years-I came off of it for a short time but the anxiety caused me to return to it again. Like most depression sufferers I have tried many drugs over the years but this one has the least side effects and works great. I occasionally get dry mouth so you do need to stay hydrated.  I was a smoker and a drinker and have kicked both habits as the drug really does reduce cravings for any pleasure. Unfortunately that does include sex as well-it does decrease your libido but that can be overcome if you work at it! It does not decrease the pleasure level but the desire to get started just isn't there. I did have a period of time where I was not eating as it does also take away your cravings for food. My hubby loves to eat so he makes me eat too,so I have not had anorexia since I met him but I did with my first husband. So I would say that an understanding mate goes a long way toward helping to make this drug a success. I take 150 sr upon waking and before bed. My insurer is also pushing the generic but that did not work for me. I understand there are some generics that are better than others and if the cost is a factor you could try those first. I am convinced that wellbutin treats alcoholism because it runs in my family and I was a problem drinker until I took wellbutrin. I can have a drink now and not want another-but that may just be me. It is sure worth a try if you drink too much-I don't know why it is not more widely used for treating alcoholism because it works. You do have to take wellbutrin for 60 to 90 days to get the full effect of the drug.During that time you do have dry mouth but that subsides after a while and was not a significant problem for me. I am 62 years old so I don't know how much longer I will take it but the doctors seem to think that it is a lifelong drug. It has made a drastic change in my life and I recomend it highly!!

I have tried it all.  Paxil made me sleepy and sweat but relieved anxiety, Prozac gave me tons of energy but made me 'crazy' and moody, Cymbalata made my anxiety go thru the roof, Celexa didn't do anything. I was on Zoloft for years, it was great for the anxiety but not the depression.  I slept a lot and just had no ambition to do anything more than I had to. I am now on the generic of this - 150 the first week and I am in day 2 of 300mg.  I LOVE IT SO FAR!!  My energy is through the roof, my fog of depression has lifted and I feel great.  My only side affect so far is that I seem to have an aching back, that could be due to the anxiety level needing to balance out.  However, I will take a slightly aching back over no energy and sleeping all of the time!
One thing I have learned is that everyone reacts differently to each med. so you just have to find the one that works for you."

I can cope .  I tried stopping several times, became immediately in major depression.  I started with low dose,gradually over the years increased to 300mg.  I have tried every version and every generic and brand name, each one is a little different because of absorption rate is differs from brand to brand.  All are effective, but I do notice differences if affect and side-effects.  Some are absorbed more slowly so work best when take b4 bedtime to not interfere with sleep, but others donot.  Also different people will experience different absorption rates between brands and dosages.  So you all hang in their, talk to your Dr.

The first few days on 150 mg were a little scary.  I had a headache the entire time.  This only lasted about 3 days.  On the fifth day started 300 mg.  Loved the energy boost and eveniness of my mood. I also immediately quit smoking...have tried quitting many times before with no success. I started getting bad cramps and realized I was horribly constipated.  Tried upping my fiber and fluid intakes but nothing helped.  I had to stop taking it because of this...BUMMER.  I really liked this med and wish I could continue but I can't take laxative everyday to conteract the constipation!!!!!!!  Some decrease in sexual desire did occur.  My doc prescribed me Effexor XR and I filled the ordered but I do not think I will try this one because of the horrible things I have been reading about it.  I will be asking her about Cymbalta because the reviews seem much more positive.  I wish the makers of Wellbutrin/Bupripion could fix the constipation issue because it worked great for me!

I wasn't given the XL to start off with and for some reason...just couldn't remember to take 1 pill 3 times a day.  I am a SUPER busy mom and full time college student (aren't we all super busy though?).  Anywho, After 2 weeks I went to the doc to let him know about my difficulty and THEN he gave me the XL...it is SO much easier taking 1 pill in the morning and being done with it.  So far, things seem to be improving.  I am on the 300.  It has ALSO cut back my craving to smoke (AWESOME..since taxes went through the roof..again).  My depression seems to be getting a little better but I haven't experienced any weight loss that I was REALLY looking forward to.  LOL!  
I am giving the XL a month to ""kick in"" and hopefully by then my depression will have subsided or at least decreased more.  Oh...ALSO...I AM tired ALL THE TIME!  But if the medication helps me smile again and feel ""normal"" then perhaps less sleep and an occasional redbull will make it all worth while  :o)
Good luck to everyone who is taking this...I not only hope it works for me...but for all of you as well!!!

Wellbutrin was effective in those areas but once I was  told to increase from one table to one and a half the gates of hell were open. I began to fell trapped in my own body and wanted to get out by killing my self. I would cry uncontrollable and even wanted to kill my husband. It felt like I was walking in water. I was told by a pastor to stop taking this immediately. Once I stopped I have not had a day of depression. I used to get depressed often. My advise is do not take this med unless you really have to try to quit smoking and lose weight on your own. I pray that those of you who are taking this will not experience the negative effects that I had.

My doctor bumped me up the the XL. It started working almost immediately. It felt as if the veil and earmuffs had been removed and colors and sounds became real again. I was extremely happy with the 50 lbs I lost. Sex drive came back with a vengeance. No listed side effects. It is now Feb 2009 and it doesn't seem to be working anymore; back to being irritable, short tempered and just sad. Going to Dr in 2 days to see if something else will work. One side effect that I can't find anyone else having is it messed with my period, even on birth control. My period would come whenever it wanted regardless of what week of pills I was on. Once I switched to taking the BCP at night and Wellbutrin XL in the a.m. it seemed to get MUCH better. Now that the wellbutrin isn't working as great, my cycle is completely whacked. Usually one week w/o it, then get it for a few days, then another week w/o, etc. Doctors say it has nothing to do with each other but I have been on the same BCP for almost 6 years and it didn't happen until I started taking the Wellbutrin XL.

I combine Wellbutrin XL 150mg with Adderall XR 15mg during the week, and take just the Wellbutrin on weekends (when I don't work).  I have had few negative side effects-- the two noticeable are the dry mouth (the dryness affects intercourse as well) and hair loss, which I experienced when I was on the 300 mg dose.  I backed down to the 150mg and the hair loss has stopped.  I am grateful I was prescribed this drug first-- it really does work quite well.

I've been on Wellbutrin for (about) a year and MUST comment on the effects of the generic brand, Bupropion (Sp?). 
   Because I don't have insurance, I spent a while on the generic version and failed to progress out of my depressive state. For a few weeks I felt like I was mildly feeling a change, but eventually it felt like I had plateaued, and shortly after, I returned to spiraling downward. 
   There were other medications added and subtracted to Wellbutrin in order to determine the right combination of drugs to aid my depression/anxiety/ADD. I AM POSITIVE that my only improvement was the result of other medications (Lamictal- mood stabilizer). 
   It has been documented that the generic version of this drug does NOT produce the same progressive results as the name brand. I can confidently say, that my experience w/ Bupropion was not a good one, in fact, I'd say it was horrible, and at times, worse than my initial state.
   I have been back to taking the name brand Wellbutrin XL for about 3-4 months. I have continued to feel a drastic improvement in my mental state, and finally recognize the person that I knew I always was. It has enabled me to live my life again.   
   Although I have felt such a great improvement, the cost is $167 (that's with insurance), which is the CO-PAY! Without the insurance, the cost is $230-$270, and very few insurance companies offer reasonable coverage for Wellbutrin XL, since the generic version was approved."

It definetly helped me overcome my depression for a while. However the drug did give me seizures. I'd take 5 or 6 Wellbutrins a day (as opposed to one)to get high and lose wieght. This gave me grand mal seizures. I stopped the drug and resumed my pill regimen months later, vowing to take only one pill a day. I did, but still had seizures. The seizures weren't a result of overdosing on the wellbutrin. They happened because I was taking them while abusing street drugs (Ecstasy and Cocaine). Please, tell you doctor if you have a drug problem or are prone to overdosing on OTC/prescription pills for fun. I crashed my car into a tree during one of the seizures I had.

After 20 years of experimenting with SSRIs, I have an almost ideal combo of Wellbutrin XL (generic) 150 mg each morning PLUS Lexapro 10 mg each night. Wellbutrin made me hyper at first, so I lowered the dosage. It has no negative sexual side effects, so it balances Lexapro nicely (in fact, it has the opposite effect). No weight gain, late-night munchies, sleeping all the time. It's truly different from all the rest. Effexor was awful, Paxil made me fat, Zoloft made me sleepy, Prozac made me nuts, and none of those helped my depression. Wellbutrin saved me, I don't build up a tolerance (even after 10 years), and its generics are so much cheaper than the alternatives. If you're not doing well with the standard Rx, try this...it's truly different, and ask your doc about combining meds.

This morning my doctor said sometimes it just doesn't work anymore. She prescribed Cymbalta so I'm going to wean off of Wellbutrin while weaning onto Cymbalta over the next 6 weeks.  I do know people who got WORSE using Wellbutrin, I know some who love it after years of use. I was right in the middle. I loved it but it just stopped working.

Isn't long before (24-48 hours) before I notice a difference and get back in control. 
Unfortunately, my medical insurance changed this year and instead of a $35.00 co-pay, it is now $215.00 co-pay for the Wellbutrin. I am guessing it is to force folks to get the generic.

I need it every night...the withdrawal effect is unbearable...2 to 3 days is the longest I've gone in not taking...also extreme inner ringing in my ears..sounds like I'm in a house full of crickets!! Maybe the 300mg is too much...anyone else experiencing the same!? Go to doc next week...we will see...

I was tired all of the time, craveing junk food, and gaining weight, not to mention zero sex drive. I just started taking 300mg of Wellbutrin Xl a week ago and I am more anxious now. My craveings did stop. Still no sex drive. Also, when I try to sleep in the dead of silence I swear I hear an inner ringing in my ears. I don't know if it's all in my head or if I really am having negitive side effects. I also find it very hard to sit still in class. I also have the same old feeling of hoplessness and anxiety about everything. Does anyone have any input on this?

I take seroquel 400mg, so that knocks me out.  I used to have nightmares, but ever since I was put on the generic, not so much. I still wake up scared sometimes.  I dont know if its just me but I feel that the generic is not as effective. I dont have any side effects really unless the dreams count. It works wonderful for me. I love it.

2711$Condition: Depression$12/23/2008 5:18:12 PM$Reviewer: BobbyPeru, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$4$5$Prior to this medication (I take the generic, Bupropion XL), I had tried a couple of different medications. None of them worked well.  Then, my doctor prescribed this. After about three weeks, I noticed that I would wake up without the customary depression that had been afflicting me for over a year and a half. Mind you, the depression has not gone away, but it has lessened greatly. The medication also sped up my metabolism and I lost weight. Nice. I also have more energy and my mind is not as lethargic as before. I take the medication with Lamictyl for anxiety and mood swings. Bupropion's side effects are occasional hyperactivity,  occasional stomachaches and frequent visits to the number for number 2, which may be caused by my sped up metabolism. Furthermore, my libido has increased and my performance in that department has improved. I am fortunate to be taking these medication and hope the benefits to not subside with time. Again, I emphasize that the depression has not ceased completely, but it has lessened in frequency and intensity.

When I would have a low, although less often, they would feel like life or death lows. And my tension increased. But it did change things, atleast, just not for much better. But different, but still bad, is better than same and still bad.

It was easy to use. Only thing is trying to take it regularly and trying not to get drunk while taking it.

I'm pretty neutral about satisfaction. I believe it may work for some, but it increased my volatility, although it did do *something*, atleast.

However, I continue to have anxiety and constant worry (Generalized Anxiety Disorder).  It appears that Wellbutrin does not list this as one of the treatable conditions.  I am considering switching to Prozac instead.  One major plus about Wellbutrin is that it has had no sexual side effects on me, unlike other antidepressants I've tried before such as Paxil and Lexapro.  Also, I haven't had any weight gain from taking Wellbutrin; however, my appetite has increased (I get hungry quicker).  If depression is the only condition to be treated, then I would recommend Wellbutrin.

2743$Condition: Depression$11/26/2008 8:41:43 AM$Reviewer: tat2moon, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$3$5$I'm 27, female, with a long history of severe depression. I've been taking generic Wellbutrin 75mg for less than a week now, and so far it seems to be helping. I'm sometimes groggy in the morning, but it goes away and I feel awake and clear-headed all day. One unusual thing: by evening I sometimes feel anxious, and two nights ago I had a full-blown panic attack and could not stop crying and feeling scared. I had a very stressful day at work though so maybe I can attribute the panic to that. I also notice changes in my appetite, like I will be hungry but not want food, or feel full after three bites of something. My energy level seems better, and I don't feel a lack of sexual desire like I did before the drug. The flat, gray feeling seems to be lessening. Overall, I do feel better, like a fog has been lifted off of me.In two weeks I'll switch to the brand-name version at 150mg, so hopefully things keep improving. Hope this helps!

I was originally prescribed Ritalin but can not take stimulants due to a weird reaction and I developed Tourettes Syndrome.  After years of trial and error with medications I have settled with Strattera 60mg and Wellbutrin XL 150 mg.  They work well together. The Wellbutrin helps with ADHD, depression, and helps balance the irritability I get from strattera, however it does make me more anxious, which is hard to live with.  The Strattera lets me concentrate and my grades are decent in my third year college. 
With any drug there are side affects but after six years the Wellbutrin is still working. It doesn't seem as harsh as other drugs and the weight management is just a bonus.  If I forget to take it my day is not so smooth.

Honestly, it was like putting on a pair of glasses for the first time after not realizing you'd been looking a blurry world.  It did make it easier to get up in the morning, it didn't affect my weight, it didn't affect my sex drive or the quality of sex, AND it really improved my daily depression.  Apparently it is the only anti-depressant that doesn't have any usual sexual side effects, if that's something important to you.

Worked great! In addition, I found it 'energizing' and started wondering if I was dysthymic as well. Found it much easier to get out of bed in the morning and less dependent on drinking coffee to perk up.  I've taken 150mg once a day in the morning for several years and I'm very pleased with the results.  I tried taking the recommended BID dose, but the evening dose would keep me up at night and vivid dreams. I currently feel like the positive effect are slightly wearing off and I would like to slightly increase my dose to 200 mg daily in the AM.  Again, very thankful that I discovered this medication and I think it has helped me tremedously.

It worked wonders but now my body has adjusted and I seem to be back where I started. After reading some of these responses, I wonder if it is because my prescription coverage had me switch to the generic version.

I did not tolerate it well at all. The first day was fine, but then the second day I felt ""dopey"" and ended up in bed with a fever later on that night. After that experience I stopped taking it but still had a low fever for a few days. I also had a weird sensation in my head that is difficult to describe. It almost felt as though I was about to lose control and have a seizure. After stopping this too went away. I will say that I am very sensitive to medications, so this may work well for some, just not me or other people with the same sensitivity. If you are sensitive to meds make sure to discuss the risks of this medication with your doctor."

I was on Zoloft which was great because I slept so well--but I was sleepy all day!  So, my doc put me on this--150mg.  Make sure you take it in the morning so you can go to sleep at night.  I never felt speedy at all (maybe because this wasn't the first med for me).  
This works pretty well for anxiety, but it would probably work better with therapy (I'm looking for another Dr).  They're probably going to up my dose for ADHD so we'll see how that goes.  TWO AWESOME THINGS: 1. I never smoked that much but I did smoke, and now it is not appealing at all to me.  2. My sex drive has never been higher!  My boyfriend is very satisfied with this med!

I don't cry at everything anymore- in fact, hardly at anything, I'm not as socially aggressive when I get angry, and it takes considerably more to make me angry.  I am still irritable, and that's something I wish would get better, but I'm glad not to be so miserable and ""blah"" everyday... I figure, at least I'm not an emotional wreck and I can at least tolerate some of the things that were making me feel terrible before.  Also, I have definitely experienced decrease in appetite... I don't eat much during the day, but sometimes at night I'll wake up and find myself going to the fridge to make myself a sandwich because I'm so hungry from not eating all day!  Also, I find it more difficult to fall asleep, and normally I go to bed pretty early and have no issues, so it's weird for me.  Other than the appetite and insomnia this med seems ok.  I might consider doubling up to see if it will help my irritability, but I will give it another week."

I have been on WellbutrinXL (generic since it became available) and Depakote (ditto) for 12 yrs. Best years of my life by far. Wellbutrin with marginal dose of Depakote keeps me out of any significant depression, while allowing me the very slight hypomania that enhances creativity, productivity, and sociability (like a safe ""6"" or ""6.5"" on a 0-10 scale, zero being suicide).

I started treating my disorder with prozac which threw me completely off balance and gave me severe moodswings. I moved on to Effexor which was effective for a bit over a year but then lost effect. My doctor then changed me to Wellbutrin XL which has been great. While I had no side-effects onthe original brand, I decided to try the generic brand. I gained a lot of weight ad fell a bit into a slump- a doctor I consulted told me the generic brand had a shorter half-life than the original; making it less effective. 
MOREOVER- WHILE ON THE GENERIC BRAND (2 months) I HAD AN EPISODE OF SEVERE SEIZURES!!
My neurologist told me to avoid the generic Wellbutrin as it put you at greater risk and that he had two other patients with the same situation."

Rather than increase the Effexor my doctor decided to add the Wellbutrin. I also saw a Clinical nurse on the recomendation of my therapist. She said she wasn't that familiar with this combination but if it was working she said not to change. She said she would have probably increased the Effexor to a higher level. She said most doctors get nervous with that and usually add another medication. Right now I am feeling better and will only call my therapist or clinical nurse if the depression comes back.

Other pills that I have taken usually keep you awake a night.  Who knows maybe I have not taken it long enough.  I called my Dr today and he wants me to wait another week.  He feels it is not in my system yet.  So far, nothing has changed except for the anger.   We will wait and see!

Wellbutrin, I thought was a lifesaver until I begin to slow down and do ""normal"" things in my life. While being an athlete, I did not have the time to sit down and notice the impact of this medication; however, once becoming a mother, I noticed the zombie in me. I literally felt like a zombie once re-prescribed this medication (I did not take the medication while pregnant). Times where it was perfectly normal for me to cry (like a funeral) I would not cry at all. I was desensitized to the world around me to include my newborn. I immediately took myself off the medication without the guidance of the doctor (bad idea - but at the time it worked for me). I did not have any withdrawal issues, which is a good thing! Nevertheless, I begin to try other medications in hopes of addressing my depression. But, I did not want to go through life feeling numb. In the end, I have turned to herbal treatment which is working wonders for me. I will NOT go back to this medication. I promised myself and those who love me. "

Three days after starting to take 300mg, I broke out in hives just on my face. I couldn't leave the house until they went away! I also feel a little absent minded, spelling words wrong and forgeting what I was doing. I didn't have these problems with the 150mg.

There seem to be two types of generic pills; I found one didn't help me at all, but the other one (purple colored) was as effective as the brand name version.

I think it is important to note however that this drug caused me to noticeably shake my hands all day. I am a phlebotomist and this had a negative affect on my job. Also, while it takes away the depression, it causes your mind to not really care about anything. Sure, your not depressed, but you become emotionless. Maybe my side effects were due to the combination but I just want to stress the fact that you need to be very careful before just taking what is prescribed to you by the physician. I believe I had TOO much drug therapy.

I have been trying to find somthing to just get me through this time so I can be sane for my family- not to pretend it is not there. I am on my second month on Welbutrin. It took at least a month to kick in. I was irritated easily for the first few weeks, but that went away a few weeks ago. I have lost just a few pounds and I do not feel like a flat line like I did on Lexapro. My sex drive is also still intact, thank God! The only downfall is that every night I get nausea, wich is why for me, it is not easy to use. My doc says to wait it out a few more weeks and make sure to take it every MORNING (I work nights so I took it later) I tried to have two drinks one night, and almost vomitted. I also got airsick for the first time. But I laugh again, and I am ready to be there for my mom now, who will be undergoing a stem-cell transplant soon. The stress is not gone- but I can at least handle it better now.My husband and mom both need me too much for me to wallow in misery all the time. If only I could get rid of the damn nausea! Oh yea, my husband said he noticed my memory has been better. I used to think depression was somthing you could talk yourself out of. Somtimes you have nothing left to give, and that is when it is time to see a doc or counseling to search what is right for you. I hope this helped someone because alot of the others helped me. Good luck!

So I am trying Cymbalta.  I guess I will have to wait and see.  I wouldn't take Wellbutrin again, it really wasn't worth it.

She was only 42 years old. The psychiatrist prescribed this to also help me deal with my child being hyperactive.

CONS: It made me feel very hot, sweaty, uncomfortable. If I take it in the morning I am tired, if I take it at night I am wide awake. As a mother of toddlers I need my sleep.

PROS:
Helped with anxiety, weightloss, nervousness.

I have learned getting over a death is not easy but with medication, relaxation and talking it out helps.

On the other hand, I am not sure what is worse the anxiety etc. or the terrible sweats and feeling like I have a terrible fever and cannot move at times.

If you are concerend and will not take medication due to weight gain, this is the medication for you."

The only thing about Zoloft was, not only did it take away the anxiety...it took away all my emotions!! I was numb. Was not sad, was not happy, just didn't feel anything. A friend of mine's infant died recently, and I was sad for her in my head. I wanted to cry, but couldn't.  It also takes away the libido. Yeah...that sucks. So my doc switched me to Wellbutrin 100mg, and at first, just like a post I read earlier. I felt drugged, tired and wierd. I kept taking it though. It's been about a month, and I love it.

Could the anxiety come from Wellbutrin or taking less Effexor? Have been on Effexor for only 5 weeks, tolerated it well. Before then I was on Lexapro. Effexor and Lexapro help my emotional symptoms but physically I feel run down and constantly fatigued. That's why we're trying different drugs now.

I recently resumed taking it again after being off of it for almost 6 months due to problems with my insurance. For the past two days I have suffered with horrible anxiety attacks, I had to go to the emergency room yesterday. I have never had anxiety attacks or anxiety problems before. I think I would rather be depressed than experience anything like that ever again. I felt like I was on acid or losing my mind or something. In addition to the new anxiety, it has also caused me to be continuously either constipated or have diahrrea, nothing in between. It also gave me insomnia, which by itself is  manageable but coupled with anxiety it can drive a person insane. I will not take this drug again, even if it means crying out my depressions and talking myself out of suicide. Be careful and be prepared.

After being depressed and not recognizing myself for about a year and a half I decided to do something about it.  My doctor put me on 300 mg of the XL.  And I had some of the side effects like not sleeping, dry mouth, lower libedo.  But the whole libedo and sleeping thing now have subsided and with the whole dry mouth I just drink a lot of water.  Which isn't a bad thing.  I love this drug, I have more energy during the day, I am back to my old happy self.

Wellbutrin XL made my life hell for my close friends and family as well as myself. I went off over how beds should be made, to what color shirts were. I'm still dealing with the aftermath of stopping all mood adjustment drugs now. This made me loose myself and control of my actions. Something I never want a drug to do for me.

My doctor switched me to wellbutrin sr (which didnt work as well for me) but the time i was on wellbutrin xl, it changed my life! Grades improved, I was getting honors (something I had never gotten before) and I was very very driven and motivated to do things. It helped my concentration so much and my desire to accomplish things in my life. I will give this warning: once being on it for long periods of time I felt great and felt like I didnt need meds anymore. I would stop taking it and within a month later would have horrible episodes from being off of it. This happened to me about three times. Once your on it, it is hard to get off but it definately improved my life. I am now on an SSRI and have found that I have no emotion at all and its hard to feel anything. While on wellbutrin, I still could feel emotions,etc. It didnt take every feeling away from me totally. This is a good drug to take, especially for a teenager, that is when I started it. I attribute all my accomplishments to this drug, I realy would not be where i am today without it and I am looking in to going back on it in combination with my SSRI

I've been on it since it was created. If you want further info you can email me b/c it won't all fit here: [email protected] This drug works for depression & smoking cessation-no doubt. However, don't expect to be able to stop taking it, in my case, perhaps ever. 5 x's I've stopped. The 1st 3 were due to no insurance & by the 3rd I was 'rationing' pills and splitting them in half. The 4th was an attempt to ween myself and the 5th was w/a Dr.'s assistance that Rx'd another drug to ease me off. I CANNOT BE WITHOUT THIS DRUG. It's a horrendous 'rubber band effect' I call the ""crash n burn"". It took awhile for me realize that It may be a month or so after it's out of your system to happen, but it will happen, and it will be harsh. I have taken this drug w/little conjunction of other drugs and know that it works to promote an overall sense of well being. BUT there are side effects [for me-everyone is different and thus cannot be expected to have the exact same experience]. For me I do have dry mouth, periodic insomnia, lower sex drive and constipation (the latter 2 were present before, just intensified by the drug). I feel like a Rx junkie, getting low on this drug causes me to panic. I have hoarded it for ins. changes. You win GSK- you now own me. I hope you're happy and proud of yourself. Despite choosing to be happy and not wanting to rely on a chemical to make that be, I no longer can. Perhaps I'm being too harsh on GSK and I truly have a chemical imbalance that will always need to be corrected??? Could be. I just think the warning should be known of how powerful Wellbutrin really is. Is it a miracle drug or the socially acceptable form of crack or smack? I have developed a love/hate relationship with it at this point in my life. I love to take it and fell good and I hate to take it and feel weak for needing it. Straight up depression just blows. Too indescribable to an outsider about how it actually feels. "

I was crying almost everyday, on my days off from work I would lay on the couch and would not get up all day. I had stopped going out with friends, gained over 30 lbs, and overall just didn't care about anything. I decided it was time to take action and as much as I thought, oh this is a phase and I will snap out of it, I realized I couldn't do it on my own anymore. I started out at 150 mg and yes, there were side effects. I couldn't sleep at night, I lost my appettite (which I didn't mind), I was alot more anxious and kind of trembly, and I was sweating alot more and really thirsty. At first I was like, I can't do this, I work 12 hours a day I need sleep and food and, etc. These side effects lasted for about 2 months. For the sleeping issues I started taking this medication right when I woke up in the morning, about 5:30 am. I noticed that this helped me have more energy through the day and wore off toward the evenings but, still I was only sleeping like 4 hours a night. I started taking Xanax and Ambien, not together and not every night, but this helped alot. I have been on this medication for almost a year now, my doctor upped my dose to 300mg, I am soooo much more motivated, happy, and I have found me again.I have lost over 20 lbs and like I said this medicine gives me energy and the motivation to workout now and care about what I look like. The nervous, anxious, trembling feeling has gone away. I still sweat a little moe than usual and am thirsty but, it is not a major thing to me, I have adjusted. I would really recommend this mediaction to anyone who was having the symptoms of depression like I was. And, those symptoms weren't at certain times in the season or just every once in a while, yes they were worse during winter then summer. I was on a roller coaster of emotions up and down and I needed major help. Give this med. a try, ride out the side effects if you can, it is worth it in the end!!!!

I have no negative side effects. If anything, my side effects are positive - increased sex drive and slight weight loss. I'm on 300mg currently and probably need to up it a little as I still get depressed occasionally. All other drugs I've taken have made me extremely lethargic and disconnected. I have none of that with Wellbutrin.

I had been severely depressed for over a year, and bad circumstances beyond my control that happened in 2007 made it even worse.

It is also a great energy booster and I feel like I'm accomplishing much more than I had for so long.
BUT...I have a terrible time trying to sleep.  Even with taking a sleeping pill, I average 4-5 hours of sleep a night.  While I don't want to stop taking Wellbutrin, the insomnia is a real problem, and as of yet my doctor and I haven't found a way to overcome it. "

Yes, I was sad but thought it was because of circumstances in my life at the time.  He prescribed Wellbutrin XL.  Wow, I can't believe how it evened out my mood.  My life is once again normal.  It takes the rough edge off and I am much nicer to be around.  I do have to watch my weight though, seems to have put some pounds on.  That's minor to losing friends, a marriage and even the dog feared me.  Wellbutrin has saved my marriage for sure.

I take Wellbutrin XL in the morning and Lexapro at night.  I was a little nervous starting it again because of what it did the last time, but I am having no problems with it this time. Id recommend it but only in conjunction with something else. I also go to therapy now, so maybe that is one reason why the effect is different now than before.

It worked and I don't smoke anymore. Then I realized I like the new me and realized I had undiagnosed depresion. After 2 years of taking it I went to a new OB-GYN for my yearly and she inadvertantly changed me to Wellbutrin XL (it stays in your system twice as long as the SR). I didn't think anything of it as I am a RN and work in a pharmacy where the standard is the XL dose. After 3 1/2 to 4 months I started having blurry vision(I had LASIK 2 1/2 years ago), nausea, diarrhea, dizzyness, then anxiety, jittery, then shaky and rapid heart rate with missed beats. So bad that one day I clocked out and went to the ER. My heart was racing at 120-135 beats per minute. They sent me home on a Holter monitor to record my heart and it came back with frequent sinus tachycardia with occasional premature atrial and ventrical beats. Not realizing the drug switch, I was positive that my thyroid was out of wack. Had all the tests even changed doctors since I didn't think the first doc was doing enough. Finally I asked an eye doctor if Wellbutrin could be causing my vision problems and he told me to get it changed. I start a new medication in the morning, so we will see if it works for me.

It helped me stay motivated in school and work and helped me get things done that I would let slip away before. However, if I forgot to take it for a couple few days I would get really irritable, more than I've ever been. Eventually I cut myself down to 75 mg a day and I'm seeing how that goes. I don't feel that I need it as much as I used to. I went about a month without it and I did pretty good. Now I've switched to the generic brand for insurance reasons and I will see how that goes.

I think many of the side affects are caused by lack of sleep while ""adjusting"" to this medicine. Seretonin is what keeps our Sanity, and is only produced when we sleep well, 8 hrs. For Smoking, I am surprised how my breakfast and coffee does not include a Cigarette afterwards. I will set a target date to quit after 2 months. This does not remove my anxiety or panic attacks like Paxil did, they must affect the mind differently. I am concerned about the possibility of a seizure on this medication as I am also a Drinker. Overall for smoking it seems to be a very helpfull crutch vrs cold turkey."

After spending a year getting off of it, and another year trying to stay off of Anti-depressants altogether (cognitive therapy as alternative) I threw in the towel and sought 'something new' from healthcare provider.  Aside from forgetting to take it some days, I seem to tolerate it well.  I've not exactly been happy-go-lucky, but considering the despair I'd experienced during the preceding year, I feel it's been effective overall.  I'm not where I want to be yet, but I can conceive of 'getting there' - which is major progress in my book.

I was generally in good moods and my moodswings were less intense. After about five months it stopped working, so my doctor put me on 300mg. There is a noticable difference in moods depending on whether you take it in the morning or at night. Taking it in the morning was difficult to remember, so i resumed taking it at night with my Seroquel. It is a stimulant and could be good for use in the morning if you are a morning person-- no one likes being awake but grumpy in the morning. Overall, i like this drug. It has been the most effective anti-depressant I have taken in a span on 6 years.

It does curb depression and make life more manageable.  I tried to get off of it twice, thinking I did not have depression anymore, but I do, and always will.  I am a generally happy person, and work on a lot of projects.  I can see the glass half full or half empty.  WellbutrinXL oral helps me see the glass half full.
I have tried several other anti-depressants, including one that is supposed to help for chronic pain.  That one had too many sexual side effects.  The other one had a weight gain factor.  One of them made me MORE depressed.  One made me tired.  WellbutrinXL oral allowed me to have energy, lose a small amount of weight, I had no sexual side effects, and was able to wake up in the morning.  It gave me more energy than the rest of them.  I am very happy with it, and would recommend it to a friend.  I even heard it helps people quit smoking."

In fact, this medication has an unpleasant odor and taste when taking.  I have to take an acid reflux med to keep from throwing up, and it doesn't always work.  The meds work, but hurt my tummy.  I am diabetic II under control.  I dread the a.m. and evening meal, as I have to eat and then take the meds ---except for the welbutrin in the evening.  I've been diagnosed since August, 2007, so I'm still working on everything.  I do not like throwing up anywhere, and especially at school.  I teach school.  To help, I take Lithium Carbonate 300 mg. twice daily.  I also take Glucophage 1000 mg. twice daily.  I take Calcium Citrate + D twice daily.  In addition, 20 mg. of Crestor at night.  (My cholestrol is at 200.)  I take AcipHex, 20 mg., of the morning.  I take 15 mg. of Dalmane to sleep.  However, I do not take the Dalmane or Crestor with the night pills.

As far as I can tell, the Welbutrin is working -- when I can keep it down.  I do think it is a combination of pills.  The Lithium is new since August ---- I had been on Depacote since 1999.  If you have any suggestions on which pills to take, and then the others to help the nausea, please feel free to advise.  Thank you for listening to me!"

Never tried to stop before this med.  Took Wellbutrin for about 2 months and stopped smoking completely (with no cravings) in about 1 month. Been nicotine free for 5 months. 

HOWEVER, was depressed when started med due to minor surgery & was smoking excessively. Doc Rx wellbutrin, and ALL habits stopped, INCLUDING wanting to be married(nearly 30 years) and being a parent to my children.  I became manic and cried ALL the time.  I stopped the wellbutrin, but these 'habits' have been damaged.  ALTHOUGH I don't know exactly how this med works, I know it's responsible for my dramatic change in personality, which is not good.  I'd rather be a smoker and never had this drug mess with my neurons.  

Hopefully the drug makers read these comments.  I'm telling you something is wrong with this medication.

I've taken several other antidepressants with varying sucess. Wellbutrin works well, but has none of the unpleasant side effects, like emotional numbing or decreased libido. I've also managed to quit smoking as the nicotine simply doesn't affect me anymore.

After smoking for 18 years...I quit.  Yes, it did cause some nausea at first...however you must eat when taking this medication.  Take with meals.  Also, don't give up.  It also has a side effect which decreases hunger.  I lost weight after quitting smoking...about 10 lbs.  I was scared after quitting smoking I would gain.  I didn't I lost.  This medication is a wonder drug.  It is rough in the begining as your body adjust.  It's not fun but give it time the side effects will go away and it is effective overall.  I really support the use of this drug.  I am an RN and also think if this drug does not help with smoking cessation try Chantix.  I am an Open Heart Nurse and we have had great success with our patients on Chantix.

I took the XL, 150mg for the first week and felt fine and then the dose was increased to 300mg a day. It helped me quit smoking and I've been smoke free for 6 months! However it sucked for my depression. When i was on 150mg i felt fine but once it increased to 300mg i felt tired and sluggish all the time. I tried it for 3 months and finally i had to be taken off it cause it was too strong. It is good if you want to quit smoking.

I also take xanax. I stopped taking the xanax for about two weeks and had a seizure. This was the first time I had ever had one. I was taking 300mg once a day in the morning. I then stopped taking the wellbutrin, but struggled with the depression again. I am now on 150mg once a day. I feel better mentally, but sometimes I feel a little dizzy the morning if i drink the night before. it also makes me sweat like a pig. The results are soo good that i can live with the stuff that comes along.

I recently was prescribed wellbutrin due to anxiety and addiction to cigarettes. I took it for 3 weeks and yes quit smoking but had more anxiety than ever and more depression. I had many fits of out of control crying and anger. My boyfriend brought the medication I was on to my attention because he knew that i was a little on the emotional side but not possessed. I even had a week long outbreak of hives. Although I am only 90% sure this was the medications fault. I was so distracted at all the other stuff I was going through I did not crave cigarettes and as far as drinking was involved I got sick after two drinks so I am taking a vacation from alcohol as well. I still have hives on and off so hopefully in another 24 hours the medication should be completely out of my system and hopefully hive free. I will finally be able to breath peacefully and with out a cigarette in my hand."

I took Wellbutrin and it made me VIOLENT! I had the most disturbing thoughts and dreams. It was soooo frightening. I have never been violent nor have I had violent thoughts or dreams until I took wellbutrin. No other medication ever made me feel this way, just Wellbutrin and I have taken many in my years. PLEASE be careful when taking this medication as with any other but I would rather be without anything in my system than to feel I want to harm others like I did with this medication. Needless to say, I IMMEDIATELY stopped this drug and never touched it again.
