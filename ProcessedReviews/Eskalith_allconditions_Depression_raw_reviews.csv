14$Additional Medications to Treat Depression$4/27/2018 12:02:49 PM$Reviewer:  Female  (Patient) $1$1$1$I used Roxane generic brand for years and have done well. My pharmacy switched to Glenmark. Big mistake. Within a few days I experienced withdrawal symptoms and started realizing that the Glenmark was not doing its job. I was having stomach upsat, extreme fatigue, anhedonia--all symptom of recurrung depression.Fortunately the pharmacy will order Roxane for me. I don't recommend Glenmark.

88$Additional Medications to Treat Depression$3/1/2013 2:41:51 PM$Reviewer: [email protected], 19-24 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$5$5$I've dealth with anxiety, major depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, and bi-polar since i was about 10 years old. I am now 24 and currently take 80mg Prozac, 2mg xanax, 100mg nortriptlyine and recently my doctor perscribed me 150mg of Lithium twice a day because the other medicines worked just not enough. I noticed a difference in the first day. I was so calm and relaxed and i felt in control for once. I do want to have my doctor up my dose next time I see him, but I definitely recommened this medication to people suffering with these symptoms and to give it a chance.

169$Additional Medications to Treat Depression$5/26/2011 2:07:24 AM$Reviewer: Spykypnoyboy, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$This medication has helped me live my life and made me able to function and do things again. I no longer have that 'dark hole' depression feeling inside my head. With this medication, I'm able to smile and laugh more often. I'm also going back to school. While this medicine isn't as good as it was the first 2 days I took it, I believe I should be at my prime after a long time when the meds kick in, just like how all other medication works. I've only gained 10 lbs with this. After many tries of other pills, I believe this one is the one and will save my life

I was very depressed and had tried several antidepressants without success. I finally had a ""ray of sunshine"" after taking Lithium, but I really worry about the s/e. Mostly, I'm concerned about potential kidney problems. I met a patient one day that was just having to start dialysis and she told me that she felt it was because of long term Lithium use. I would be devastated if I had to go on dialysis with kidney failure. Also, the main thing right now is that I'm experiencing hand tremors, sometimes really bad. They started me on Inderal to treat the tremors, but it is not working. I am a nurse and it is not cool to be a nurse and have shaky hands. That really bothers me and some days are worse than others. I'm taking 900mg daily and I am wanting to be tapered off of this medicine. I can't afford job troubles. I just hope I wont return to that deep dark place that I lived in before. Whatever is wrong with me, I would not even wish it on anyone."
183$Additional Medications to Treat Depression$3/30/2011 9:20:05 PM$Reviewer: Mark, 45-54 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$I'm a disabled vet that has suffered from several major physical disabilities for many years. My life has been a emotional roller-coaster for years, sometimes being hospitalized due to my depressive episodes. I was very close to suicide, and idealized the method several days a week. I have taken so many antidepressants over the years, but, LITHIUM, has changed my life. I actually have the motivation to do something, instead of just vegatating all day and never accomplishing even the simplist tasks, like finnishing a project in the household. Prior to my starting on Lithium I was taking Depekote, which made me so drousy that I nearly feel asleep at the wheel countless times. I am Bipolar/Major Depressive disorder, and have been seeing a VA clinical Psychologist and a psychiatrist for nearly 15 yrs.
184$Additional Medications to Treat Depression$3/24/2011 12:41:22 PM$Reviewer: 45-54 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$3$5$"I have to say that yes there is a weight gain, but my doctor told me that after awhile, the weight gain would stop.  It has I'm happy to say.  Lithium has taken me from a depressed, angry, short fused anxious person to a calm, relaxed, sort of a ""whatever"" type of mood.  I can get my stuff done with no problems, I no longer worry about going out into crowds.  This drug for me has been wonderful.  As for the weight gain, like I said, yes I gained about 22 pounds, but I am now losing weight without having to really diet, but the point is, my weight gain has stopped.  My mind is clear, and I no longer feel like the world is against me, making me lash out at everyone and everything."

244$Additional Medications to Treat Depression$4/9/2010 8:34:36 AM$Reviewer: Chelle, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$5$5$I started this medication after crashing into depression from a manic phase.  I crashed so hard and fast, I tried to commit suicide.  While in the psychiatric wing of the hospital, they started me on lithium.  It was a pain to have my blood checked so often at first but in the end it is worth it.  I have not felt this good in years.  You do have to remember to drink a LOT to flush it out of your system or you will get shaky.  I have been on it since Sept. of 2009 and although I do have a lot of the side effects, it is definitely worth it!

So being already over weight this is something I had to stop because of health problems caused by the extra weight.  As far as depression it helped a lot and if I can't find another mood stabiliers I will go back to the lithium and I will have to work hard on the weight issue.

295$Additional Medications to Treat Depression$7/21/2009 4:59:33 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$3$3$I was started on Lithium Carbonate, approx 3 wks ago.  I feel better than I used to, but I could still feel better than I do now.  The side effects really scare me. For the last couple of weeks, I have noticed that my voice has been hoarse.  I have an appt to see my doctor tomorrow, to find out whats causing it. I just looked on here and found out that hoarseness is a serious side effect of taking this medicine. Tomorrow I will find out, but im very nervous right now.

317$Additional Medications to Treat Depression$4/15/2009 4:55:51 PM$Reviewer: candid, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$My personal opinion is that Lithium should not be used by anyone who is not either bedridden or institutionalized. I was not able to tolerate being at work or function outside the home. This would be the very, very last resort. I can't say that it helps the depression, either, aside from the horrible feeling of lethargy and fatigue.

Can still have a bad day if things pile up on me but generally I'm much better and no side effects.
