5$Anxiousness associated with Depression$2/25/2019 10:01:05 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$Took 5mg as prescribed finally one day to see if it would help me, made me feel anxious/restless and slightly euphoric but also gave me headaches and made it hard to gather thoughts clearly. Woke up the next day after and was still feeling the effect, the drug stays working in your system for more then a day. I discontinued use after that experience, take caution if you're considering taking it as this medication doesn't work for everyone.

Some of them are very worrisome to me!
17$Anxiousness associated with Depression$4/20/2018 8:59:45 AM$Reviewer: JamesW, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$3$3$I have taken other SSRIs before and SNRIs. For me, I felt an effect within a few hours. It comes on as very jittery and with the jaw clenching, very similar to SNRIs like Effexor. I've never had another SSRI react this way. It helps, I just hope the side effects get better.

My best example is on Christmas Eve, I dropped a bottle of soda coming out of the fridge and it exploded all over the kitchen.  I literally laughed even though I knew my company coming over were on their way.  I said, ""the old Michelle would have threw a fit, and Christmas Eve would have been ruined!""  The new Michelle just laughed it off.  I don't sweat the small stuff and I feel more rational, and feel like my old self again.  I have been on this medication for 6 months now, 10 mg."

26$Anxiousness associated with Depression$10/30/2017 4:07:02 PM$Reviewer: alex, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $4$4$5$"TL;DR; I was prescribed 10mg daily of this medication to counteract moderate anxiety. But it has helped with panic attacks as well. It was effective almost from day one and I recommend it to others.

The Bad: I got nausea the first 2 days, headaches for about a week, soft stools for about 3 weeks and a small loss in libido. 

The Good: I noticed a real difference within days of taking the medication. I'm skeptical that it was a placebo effect because they say it shouldn't have full effect till 2-4 weeks, however, I don't care and I'll take what I can get even if it was a placebo effect. I used to have panic attacks, and general anxiety to many things. I'd hold to things for days and I'd generally be down, even though I was convinced what I had was just a ""regular amount of stress"". Right away, I noticed I didn't have rash and abrupt reactions to things, things rolled off me a lot easier and I approached everything in life more calmly. I've had more focus at work, I'm able to concentrate better and I'm more engaged with family and my kids. "

I start taking this medication due to drug abuse and depression. I´ve been on it for 2 weeks now, and the side effects have been awful. I sweat a lot, I have terrible migraines, I feel drowsy and it´s very hard to concentrate. I´m hoping the side effects will diminish over time. The good news, I have not been smoking weed since I started the medication, so yay me. If you´re about to take this medication, please review the side effects and precautions. Hopefully, this will work for me 
57$Anxiousness associated with Depression$4/30/2015 8:33:13 PM$Reviewer: Selita, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$5$5$In my experience Lexapro is the only medication that has helped me manage depression, panic disorder and BMT Migraines.  Prior, I've been on a number of widely prescribed medication to treat those conditions without seeing any benefits and having my symptoms worsen. Once I started on Lexapro, panic attacks have completely stopped within two months.  Depression has become manageable and almost completely gone in about 6 months.  Added benefit in my case - BMT migraines that I've suffered from for almost 6 years have subsided to the point where I only have to watch my diet.  Occasional episodes are now easily treated with Advil.  I've been able to resume normal life after only 3 months of being on Lexapro. Warning: in my case this drug definitely has caused long term sexual dysfunction. I was able to recover, to a point. As long as I am on this drug, I don't expect to have normal, healthy sexual drive. Also, I'd warn about switching from brand name to generic escitalopram. In my case, it caused quick return of debilitating mood changes.  I have to take twice the dose of escitalopram to get the benefit of single dose of Lexapro.

I've taking for almost two years, and occasionally I forget to take it for a day or two. Almost inevitably, the chatter inside my head begins to belittle me or a sense of dread creeps back in. That's when I realize i've forgotten my dose. It has helped alleviate the nagging, underlying sense of defeat and unworthiness, without giving me any sense of a ""high."" I like the neutral feeling it provides. I don't feel any side effects. Also seems to help with perimenopause. I don't feel like crying all the time anymore."

184$Anxiousness associated with Depression$10/15/2019 3:53:35 AM$Reviewer: 25-34 on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $5$5$5$My doctor prescribed this due to my concern over constantly crying over stressful situations (due to anxiety and major depression) and it was happening on a daily basis. It was so bad that I couldn't work. The Lexapro really helped rather quickly. I'd say within a week or two I started noticing changes. I still think the same but I can brush things off that normally would make me cry. I pretty much feel like I things don't bother me as severely as they did. Sure, I still get sad and feel down at times, but they don't make me feel like it's the end of the world and I don't cry whenever I feel stressed.

About 4 months into taking it, I became even more depressed then I have ever been. I would cry every single day and nothing in my life at the time was a result of my overwhelming emotions. Once I realized this wasnâ??t normally me, I went back to the doctor. They changed my dosage. I was feeling good for a while but now Iâ??m just as anxious as I was before the medication and having panic attacks again, and I donâ??t feel like myself. This medication has made me even more depressed then Iâ??ve ever been in my life, and itâ??s almost like Iâ??ve adjusted and am feeling just as anxious. Iâ??ve talked with many others that have taken lexapro and they also werenâ??t satisfied with the effects of the drug. They didnâ??t have my exact experience but similar ones. If you take this drug, I suggest really checking in with yourself to make sure youâ??re feeling better and not worse.

208$Anxiousness associated with Depression$12/13/2018 5:42:02 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $5$5$5$I have had anxiety off and on for years, but it was always controllable. However, it became more and more progressive over the past few months where my anxiety would trigger full blown panic attacks. One day, I woke up feeling extremely anxious and it did not go away all day. The anxiety progressed so fast where I had episodes of trembling throughout the day, completely lost my appetite, and would even wake up in the middle of the night with extreme anxiety. the anxiety took over and It was all I could think about. It became so debilitating, just trying to go to the store was the hardest task in the world and I was terrified to do so. My anxiety triggered deep depression. I am usually very full of energy, work out, and happy. I have a full time job, and two young kids so I knew I had to see a doctor and get things figured out. I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Depression. I am not one to take medicine and am usually scared to do so, but anything was worth a try at this point. I was prescribed 10mg of Lexapro and within a week, felt a difference. It has been 2.5 weeks now, and I feel like myself again and like I have my life back. The medicine helped with my anxiety first, so I still felt my depression until about the second week. I personally haven't experienced any crazy side effects yet, and feel a headache or a little weight gain (if that does happen) is way better than the extreme anxiety and depression I was battling. My Dr.'s goal is to slowly lower my dose after a few months until I am good to be completely off it, as she believes my diagnosis is situational. This medicine truly saved me and gave me my life back. You just have to stick with it!

I have been taking generic for about 2 1/2 weeks. I have been very sleepy, was dizzy for the first week or so and have excessive sweating.

I noticed immediate side effects of extreme drowsiness, feeling wound up like I had drank 10 cups of coffee, on edge, in a fog, couldnt orgasm and felt an over all numbing and didnt feel like myself. 

I emailed my doctor and said I couldnt take it anymore. The side effects were driving me insane. She recommended I stop taking it and am waiting to be prescribed with a replacement. 

My partner is on the same med and same dose and he doesnt seem to be having the negative side effects like I am. "

Walking across the floor and having my bladder open up with no warning. I felt zombie like. Couldnâ??t cry. Felt dead inside. In a way, that was acceptable to me, until my Mom died and I felt nothing. Got off after a long withdrawal period. Whoever said this isnâ??t addictive is crazy. Iâ??ve been on several and prozac was the only one I was able to just stop taking. As a matter of fact, I used prozac to finally get me thru this withdrawal and then just stopped prozac. After I got off this medication. I stopped peeing all over the place. Weird.

I finally feel like I have a reason to live again and I'm actually able to enjoy social situations. Had many side effects first week including extreme irritability but all have subsided. Sexually side effects have benefited me and can now get my partner off multiple times and really concentrate on the act of pleasing rather than trying to last lol.

I was really skeptical about the side effects. I read one very positive review & it changed my mind. I am so glad i started Lexapro two months ago. I was put on Lexapro for anxiety. I was always in a bad mood & everything set me off. I started with 10mg & saw a slight improvement the first week. It wasn't until the Dr put me on 15mg about a month in that i really saw considerable improvement. Two months later i can honestly say I am am so happy to be on this medication. Everything just seems better. I am happy. I find joy in the things i used to. I look forward to social events. My mood is so much better. I did not gain weight. No sexual side affects. Please don't let other peoples experiences deter you. Give it a try!

246$Anxiousness associated with Depression$4/21/2017 10:20:47 PM$Reviewer: sommersommer, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $4$4$5$"My anxiety hit a high in my mid 20s & went from every once in a while to a constant drowning feeling of anxiety. When it became paralyzing, I started therapy. After 4 months of therapy & being against medication, I started to learn more about the illness, how it runs in my family & because the physical symptoms weren't going away I started Lexapro. 
For the first couple of months as I increased the dosage, I became extremely paranoid that I was going to become suicidal. The weird part was that I had never even thought about this before and never experienced symptoms of depression. I started to learn through therapy that it stemmed from my fear of losing control of my anxiety and myself and the worst case scenario of that would be killing myself. 
I then became extremely motivated to become the best version of myself that I could be. With more therapy, daily mental exercises, physical exercise and A LOT of hard work... I was able to shake the paranoid thoughts and have never appreciated life more than I do now. Lexapro helped with the physical symptoms but if you suffer from anxiety and panic disorder you still need therapy. The medication is just one part of the process. But with all of the hard work and a daily pep talk in the mirror, I am a completely different person than I was 1 year ago when I hit rock bottom. 
I see life different & I am so grateful for the little things because I once couldn't enjoy them because of my anxiety and physical sickness. For those who are suffering from anxiety, this is how I see it. Every day I may get a wave here & there but I can manage it and still be happy. If that is the worst thing I have to deal with that day, I will take it. Anxiety is 100% manageable and YOU HAVE CONTROL. It's all about really believing you have control and that YOU ARE NOT A VICTIM. I think it's really important we start more conversations about mental illness. We shouldn't be ashamed or afraid.I encourage all of you to keep preaching ways to overcome it"
249$Anxiousness associated with Depression$1/11/2017 6:44:02 PM$Reviewer: StephG, 19-24 on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $4$4$4$Had anxiety that creep into depression. Finally decided that I needed medication to help. First 2 weeks I had severe sweating, weird sensation in my mouth, spaciness. But they went away after two weeks or so. I still suffer now from increased sweating at night which is annoying... However the positive affect it has had on my life is AMAZING. Within days I started to feel better, clear head, consistent mood, and started to feel happy again. Would definitely recommend it. My husband is on the same drug, it took him sometime to feel the positive effects. So make sure you stick to it for a least 2 months.

I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Dysthymia causing stress induced hallucinations and panic attacks sometimes severe enough to cause suicidal thoughts. The drug started working slowly after the first week and took full effect about a 1.5 months of use. I was very tired on and off for the first 3 weeks of use. Now small things make me happy, I rarely have panic attacks and no hallucinations. I feel normal for the first time in my life. WARNING! When your doctor says to not quit cold turkey they MEAN IT. I went off my meds for a week after 3 months of use and after 3 days without had even worse severe sudden and suicidal panic attacks frequently. DO NOT SUDDENLY QUIT THIS ONCE ON IT. make sure your doctor gives you access to months of this drug as a precaution so you never run out all of a sudden. I have a 5 month at a time prescription now.

Then I was started on 10 mg Lexapro with only one side effect..no sexdrive, but it came back after 1 month. It started working in just 2 days. I was waking up happy...yes happy with not one worry on my mind. Where before Lexapro that was all I could do all day long was worry and think the worst. Now I am happy and it has been 8 weeks. This med has given me my life back better than new and my husband has his wife back and my daughter her mom. I am now focused, busy and social again. Greatful and thankful to God for taking my worrys and bringing me Lexapro. Without God I wouldn't be here right now. Try Lexapro, but also give your worries to God. He can handle them.

Used beside cognitive therapy for the first year, it is effective except for when experiencing major life changes or having a particularly bad day owing to an abnormally severe collection of stressors. When mired in a low or very anxious, recovery time is measured in hours instead of days or weeks like it used to be prior to treatment.

For context, I developed depression and social anxiety issues somewhat over a decade prior to seeking treatment. With the combination of escitalopram and cognitive therapy the amount of progress made in the management of these problems has, frankly, been surprising, exceeding my expectations."

No anxiety at all, lets me be happy and experience other emotions.  Some of these meds will reduce your sex drive; Lexapro does not.  I recommend it.

If you’re like I was, you are sitting there wondering what happened to you, why you can’t get your old self back, and if you will ever feel better again. Maybe you dread the thought of medication...your anxiety cruelly makes you feel anxious about all the anxiety medication horror stories out there. The stigma around medication holds you back. No one will talk about it in real life...Maybe you worry it will make you a zombie ... or even worse, it won’t work at all. 

I can tell you that this was me a little over a year ago...and there IS hope. I’m a mid-30's male. Lexapro (Escitalopram) saved my job, my marriage, my family......my life. Anxiety and panic attacks had completely overtaken me. I was under a constant cloud of intense dread, overwhelming anxiety, and frequent panic attacks. I couldn’t sleep or eat...I lost more than 30 pounds (and wasn’t overweight to begin with). The decision to start on Lexapro (Escitalopram) was very difficult. In a cruel twist of irony, everything about the idea intensified my anxiety. I worried about everything you’re probably worrying about ... horrible side effects, how long it would take to work, not working at all, becoming addicted...all that stuff. Finally, I couldn’t take anymore. My job was suffering, my family was suffering, and everything I used to love brought me no joy.  Basically, I dreaded every moment of every day and night. 

I finally started on Lexapro (actually, the generic Escitalopram). To be honest, it took at least 2 full months for it to completely work. Maybe even 3. There was definitely some improvement before that, but finally one day, life felt back to normal. 

I can tell you now that I have my life back. Lexapro is absolutely, completely, unequivocally incredible. I feel like my “old self” again. The overwhelming anxious thoughts have disappeared, and I haven’t had a single panic attack. When I do begin to get anxious thoughts, I find I can control them and"

(Go figure) I get really bad anxeity right before meetings or even anything related to public speaking. Which would result in me taking my negative attitude home. This really was bad on my relationship as I was very snappy at home. I'm on day 3 right now of 5mg a day and I literally feel the positive effects get better daily. Day 1; I was a bit loopy and zoned out, but had this great feeling of euphoriaa couple of hours into it. Day 2, a little dry mouth but again, my temperament was great. Things that would infuriate me, didnt or at least not as much at all. No appetite for alcohol, at all. Day 3, starting to get this new energy I havent felt in a while. Also, just had a phone meeting and it felt like I was a different person speaking. I will log the effects for the next couple of weeks and share my experience.

When I first started taking it I had an upset tummy with diarrhoea and nausea. I was perspiring more and had a general increase in symptoms of anxiety, like trembling, restlessness, nervousness and rumination. I Have just started my third week and all of those have reduced considerably. It's as if a wave of clarity has washed over me and I can take things on one at a time as opposed to feeling like I was caught up in an Avalanche and careening down a mountain! I don't have severe depression (just anxiety), but my general mood and wellbeig has improved - I have my appetite back, I'm more motivated to complete those everyday tasks, I'm less fearful of my anxiety and I can concentrate better! In my experience (on both occasions), the anxiety increased dramatically in the first week of beginning the medication - to really give it a chance, you need to batten down the hatches and get through this time. Also, give yourself the best chance by exercising, eating well and engaging in meaningful activities. Best wishes on your journey!

I noticed mild headaches on the days I upped the dosage, and I had increased daytime sleepiness for the first month, but I've had no other side effects aside from mild headaches if I accidentally miss a dose. Totally worth it for me, it's made me so much happier and healthier!

I used to not even be able to stay at work because my anxiety would be so bad that I would feel like passing out, get dizzy, my head would throb, heart wouldnâ??t stop racing, and constantly get hot flashes. When I first started taking lexapro the first week was kinda rough it made me really anxious a few times and was kinda hard to sleep/ I would wake up often in the night. But after about 2-3 weeks I started noticing how much better I was. I used to not even be able to go to the store because it was so bad and now I can go to the store when itâ??s busy, go to work perfectly fine, and I know everyone reacts different to these things but itâ??s the first thing Iâ??ve ever taken and it is working great for me.

I have even been able to taper down on my benzodiazepine with Lexapro (and all natural supplements/vitamins). I highly recommend giving Lexapro a try. BUT remember, not all meds work for all people. It may just take you a while to find one that works best for you. Don't give up!!! "

I was prescribed lexapro for some moderate anxiety I was having caused by a physical injury. I took the first 10mg pill in the morning and that night had a full blown panic attack. I had never experienced anything like that prior. I took one more pill the next morning and it led to the 4 worst days of my life. I couldn't eat or sleep and certainly couldn't work. My mind was racing non stop and the anxiety was ceaseless and I broke down crying several times. I spent all day pacing around my living room terrified that this change was somehow permanent, I was going to lose my job and my life was over. I took four days for the medication to leave my system and I was myself again. If you are experiencing this, just hang in there! It will get better again!

209$Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$11/11/2018 1:09:15 AM$Reviewer: Angie, 25-34 on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$1$"I took Lexapro once, and I still have not gotten myself to take another dose. I was prescribed 10mg of Lexapro by my NP for anxiety and depression. I haven't taken any psychiatric medication since high school for my conditions. After I filled my prescription, I took my dose at 1pm. By 4pm, I was feeling elated, lightheaded, and had some stomach pains. By 6pm, I experienced severe dry mouth, excessive sweating, and remained lightheaded and hazy feeling. My heart was also beginning to race. By 9pm, along with the previous symptoms, my blood pressure was very high, my jaw was clenching, and leg muscles were cramping, and I was feeling short of breath. I felt wired. I felt like I had taken a small dose of ecstacy (speaking from personal experience). I was extremely uncomfortable and just wanted to sleep for work. By 11:30pm, I had my mother take me to the ER, and I was given IV saline and an Ativan. My blood pressure while in the ER was around 180/110, and my heart rate was 135. Around 2am, all of my adverse signs and symptoms subsided, I was discharged, and I was finally able to sleep. Be careful of Lexapro, as it is not meant for everyone. Because Lexapro is an SSRI, it can potentially cause something called ""SEROTONIN SYNDROME,"" which is what I experienced. It can also cause this syndrome from interactions with other medication, even as simple as Nyquil. I was told to just try to tough it out and keep taking the Lexapro because ""it will get better when my body adjusts to it,"" but I really do not want to risk going through that again. Make sure you talk with your doctor so that you are well-informed before starting this medication."

It took about 5-6 weeks of taking it before I felt the full effects, but I knew that going in, so I just had to be patient and wait it out. In the beginning I did experience weird side effects like yawning, but those went away early on.  I have not experienced weight gain, thankfully.  Basically I just feel better, and more like the happy person I was before I began having anxiety. As I stated, this is the third time I've been on Lexapro, so I know the difficulties with waiting for it to take effect, and the challenges with transitioning off the medication.  All that being said, I still feel it is a life saver as I was crippled with constant anxiety attacks and wasn't really functioning in my own life. This medication literally gave me my life back.

When I moved schools the start of this year when I was sixteen I started getting panic attacks and was just not functioning at all. I just hated myself and was so angry with how I was. I got put on Lexapro 10mg and it has been the best decision I've ever made. Within the first half an hour of taking it I felt so much better. I got a bit of a high off it which apparently some people get. Also felt so calm like there was nothing in my head. After the first week it felt more normal. Now I love it life is just so much easier and I'm happier. I will probably be on it for a few years and to be honest I don't really want to get off it because it helps so much. Also though I don't want to be on it my whole life. Side effects I get are headaches and shaking/ jumpyness.

However, immediately after my first child was born, I developed a perinatal mood disorder known as OCD.  I struggled for years and refused to take medication.  About 6 months ago, my doctor and I decided on Lexapro.  It has been a game changer for me.  I am a highly functional person and some would consider me an overachiever and workaholic.  But my OCD, anxiety and ADD were interfering significantly with my ability to function, focus and sleep.  A very good friend recommended Lexapro and my doctor agreed.  I am so happy and relieved every day to have this support.  I would recommend this drug to anyone who suffers from anxiety or OCD.  I will say that the first week is a huge adjustment.  I was very tired and had migraines every day.  I also suffer from migraines and the Lexapro has significantly reduced my migraines and headaches.  I highly recommend it.

Friends and my doctor told me to stay on it. Nausea every morning. Was taking this medication after dinner. Took only 5 mg . Week 2  things started to get better with anxiety. Although I would have to take a low dose zanax every now and then. Still had the nausea and sleeping insomnia, but sleeping started to improve. Started to develop more stomach issues . More frequent heartburn. Acid reflux seemed to get worse. Sex drive was ok but erections were harder to achieve . Overall the drug seems to work after a month . It definitely does the job. But the side effects some times for me are not tolerable. I don t get excited about doing things as much. Motivation is less . And I'm tired when I get up in the morning. Still wake up once or twice a night. But I'm sleeping better. Before taking this drug , like I said, I wasn't sleeping at all. And I was taking a few sleeping pills . Now I just take a half of a 5 mg melatonin . And a half of a 0,25 mg zanax . And sleep decent. If you can get through the nausea and headaches  you should be fine. Takes a good two weeks. Drinking alcohol with this med is not recommended at all. If you do , like I did after a couple glasses of wine . Headaches and hangover . Not a good feeling, throws you off for a day or two. Hope all this helps. Still having heartburn after a month

Found out it was anxiety.  Doctor put me on Lexapro in 2010 and it has been a godsend!  I take my pill at night, before bed time.  I didn't like how it made me feel taking it in the morning. I have been taking it at night from day 2 and it sure has helped take the edge off.  I cut out all caffeine also which definitely has helped too.  I am back driving again and can ride in elevators and be in crowds and not be bothered or panicked.  It has given me my life back!!!

For the first 2 months I was having terrible jaw pain and headaches.  Doc said I needed to increase dose to 10mg.  I did, and for the first time in years, I had an anxiety attack free month.  I was able to start doing things I hadn't done in years...standing in line in busy stores, concerts, etc.  I stayed on for a year.  During the last few months, I started having side-effects.  God-Awful sweats and wait gain.  Coming off of it was a process too.  If I hadn't had the side effects, I may have stayed on.

Within days of taking it, those things got significantly better.  Been on it a few years now and it still helps me stay much calmer.  Within the last year I started feeling depressed and anxious.  Then my wife left me and I feel awesome!!!  She was constantly angry, complained about me all the time, and well many other things.  It wasn't till after we separated that I started feeling like my old self again.  I know...not much to do with lexapro but I DOES say something about living conditions and just how much they can affect your mood.  Soooo, I guess the moral of the story is don't discount the life factors around you and expect medication to solve all your problems!  Lol

Slight worry turned into full-blown panic attacks and daylong anxiety.  I couldn’t eat, couldn’t sleep (literally), couldn’t think about much else besides my health and why no one could figure out what was wrong with me.  With anxiety comes a bunch of physical symptoms and I was certain each one of those symptoms was more proof of me having some sort of undiscovered health condition, feeding into the anxiety.  After trying some relaxation techniques, exercising, reading a book about it, etc, I came to the tough decision that I was too far-gone and actually needed some medical help.  This was worst case scenario for me as I did not want to have to go on any medication.  I had never been on any in my life and didn’t want to start.  My Doctor prescribed me 5mg of Lexapro for 6 months.  Long story short, Lexapro saved my life.  It’s as simple as that.  The side effects I experienced the first 10-14 days were absolutely horrible: I basically experienced every reported side effect for at least a few days, and each day a new side effect would rear its ugly head.    I emailed my Doctor telling him I was going to give up as I was in too much misery with the side effects and my anxiety had gotten even worse.  He suggested I just give it another week and to my surprise, each side effect gradually started going away after a few days.   6 weeks into my first Lexapro tablet and I was completely back to normal.  Like the entire miserable 3 month anxiety episode I had just gone through was just a dream.  Had I bailed after 5-6 miserable days and not stuck with it, I don’t know what would have happened to me.  I finished my Doctor prescribed course of 6 months and its like the entire thing never happened. I'm back to myself 100% because of Lexapro.

Anxiety has lessened severely, panic attacks have been shut off completely. I'll get the odd strange feeling that I might be having one, again, but am able to subside it and distract myself. I'd go on trips with my friends and be a little more quiet than I normally am, but I'd honestly take that over feeling the way I did before.  Side effects have been sluggishness, lots of yawning & feeling like I just want to dive into bed and get the day over with... A bit of confusion & memory impairment at times when I wake up in the morning.  People need to understand you can't just take this and completely rely on it to fix you - You've got to get off your ass & introduce more fitness and healthy lifestyle to pair with it to achieve the best results.  I'm on a very low dose (5mg) as I don't enjoy taking pharmaceuticals. Hope to nip this in the bud and be able to understand how to cope with Anxiety & Panic attacks without the use of drugs! Feeling great now, though! No terrible side effects that some people seem to complain about!

As all antidepressants, nothing kicked in for a couple of weeks. By August, there was a week that I had an extreme manic episode. I basically acted how you would assume somebody on methamphetamine was on. The medication actually made me more paranoid, and I ended up overdosing on my medication (the first suicide attempt of two in the past six months). My doctor did not want me on an antidepressant, for I acted the same way on the last one. Be wary and don't be afraid of asking questions, especially if you've had episodes of hypo/mainia. Even if you are young(er), as me (14). If there is any history of Bipolar Disorder (even if it is only supposed), be wary as possible. I would've never expected a mental health disorder, especially one as dangerous as Bipolar Disorder. Make sure you are closely monitored, even if you act ""happy as can be"". If it's excessive, call your doctor; IMMDEIATLY. "

Some days are better than others, but overall 10 mg daily seems to work well for me. I have found that I'm very unemotional while on this medication, but that's a small price to pay for wellness. I have gained weight, but I love food, and I think that's more of a sign of happiness. When I have anxiety, I can't eat and lose weight. So I'd rather be overweight than filled with anxiety and depressed.

It was getting to the point that I had anxiety problems just worrying I would have an anxiety episode.  I became somewhat claustrophobic, even when in small rooms.  My anxiety level would go up and then I would worry about that, which made it worse.

I finally approached my physician and described my episodes to him.  He asked about depression but I felt that I did not have any symptoms.  He prescribed Lexapro 10mg, once daily.  He also gave me a small amount of Xanax 0.5mg for as needed use only.

The first day I had minor side effects, mostly a mild headache.  The second day the side effects became worse with nausea and headaches and increased anxiety.  It was bad enough I decreased my dose to 5mg the next two days.  On the 5th day, and every day since I have been taking 10mg once daily.  The side effects are nearly completely gone after just one week on the medication!!

I had almost immediate results from this medication.  I never felt I was depressed but I can tell you that my mood is greatly improved and I feel much better.  I have not noticed the anxiety levels I once experienced.  Lexapro has helped me immensely.

I'm writing this because I read so many reviews that indicated it took weeks or months for this drug to work for them.  I may be different, but it worked for me almost from day one!  I am very pleased."

Sweating a lot at night. Increased the pitch of tinnitus I already had in my ear. Restless sleep the whole time on this. Could never fall into a deep sleep. Increased appetite; gained about 20 pounds. Made anxiety worse for the first few weeks before making it better.  Immediate relief of muscle tension. Improved mood immediately. Took for about 2-3 months. Stopped because I started getting an overall sick feeling from taking the medication long term.  My body just felt like it made me feel bad. Not lexapros fault, I get that feeling when I take an antibiotic long term too, so I recognized the feeling. Noticed nerve sensations in lower lip after long term use  and when I quit taking the medicine that sensation went away. Had no problem with slowly decreasing dosage and tapering off.  Definitely worth a try to see if it works for you.  Would consider taking again.  Took name brand, not generic.

I have suffered with anxiety for a long time I tried Klonipin (Clonazepam .5) for a long time and it still wasn't doing the trick I even upped the dose and would still experience severe anxiety. I was scared to drive or leave my house, it affected me during school my grades dropped terribly. Now that I have been on Lexapro for a little over a month I feel sooo much better. I haven't had anxiety, I can deal with situations better and I feel like I have my life back. Side effect unable to reach climax. Sexual side effects are the worst but I am willing to deal with it if it means no anxiety.

I feel like I have let my family down. I still have crazy thoughts about dying even more now, anxiety attacks, sleepless nights, drink more, actually hate myself.

I also gained weight, 100 pounds. I finally put it all together and started tapering, it took 14 months to taper off of 30mg of Lexapro. The month after I started to have normal periods and I have lost 90 pounds total in the first year that I was off lexapro. Don't lose hope you will lose the weight after you safely taper off of lexapro. Before lexapro I was on Zoloft which wore off. Anyhow since being off all SSRIs I have had no panic attacks or harmful anxiety. I think that having to deal with withdrawal, it made me deal with my stress and any anxiety easily.

I guess to go with withdrawal for me was way worse than any panic attack or anxiety attack I ever had. this June I will be two years SSRI free and no panic or anxiety since off the pills. This from over 15 years of SSRI use in total."

After that it seemed to tapper off.  Still felt good, but not the awesome feeling from before. Current side effects: Dry mouth, loss of appetite, restlessness, drowsiness, easily annoyed(but not as bad as before), altered interest in intercourse, and problems with ejaculation :( .  It seems like a lot, but the fact that it chills me out so much and I don't blow up on anyone anymore outweighs the side effects, well, maybe not the sexual ones(my poor wife she's been working extra hard...LOL).  So point is, is you have to weigh it for yourself and speak to your doctor when you do have side effects to ensure it's something not serious. Also, I'm on Adderall for ADHD, which also has similar side effects, with increased erections...ugh!

Due to high anxiety levels, I was toxic to my marriage.  My wife was just about ready to give up on us.  Lexapro saved my marriage.  When generic Lexapro came out, but wife didn't tell me, but started me on generic lexapro.  Within 2 weeks, I wasn't feeling right, anxiety returned and wife could see it wasn't working at all.  She immediately called the pharmacy and doctor. By having my doctor say I needed the real Lexapro prescribed, life became good again. Yes, it is expensive now because insurance doesn't fully cover it if there is a generic.  You can appeal insurance decision, but you need to take several other lexapro family drugs and if they don't work, insurance will cover real lexapro.  I am on 10% dose and haven't experienced negative side effects, yet I still have emotions, but don't get as ugly about nothing. I wish they would pull generic lexapro from being prescribed as it does nothing and only give lexapro bad reviews.

439$Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$12/30/2013 7:39:14 PM$Reviewer: Lexa, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$2$5$I was around 30 when I was prescribed Lexapro.  At the time I was a very successful Realtor and was quite stressed with work.  I noticed I was forgetting basic things like what I had for breakfast, did I have breakfast, did I feed the dog? My short term memory was crap and it was starting to affect my life.  I couldn't remember parts of conversations.  People were telling me things that I did or said and I honestly couldn't remember it.  I had to start trusting other people's memories more than mine which I didn't like.  This went on for under 2 yrs then my doctor figured it was anxiety and we gave this a try.  I wasn't on it for very long because even though it 'mellowed me out' and I did feel less stressed from my job it was the worst.  I didn't want to get confrontational with anyone and wanted to avoid people, I only wanted to be around friends/family.  I didn't want to take phone calls or answer emails.  It basically turned me from a tiger to a kitten... which was a problem when people hired the tiger.  It made me sheepish, which might work out for some people but I wouldn't recommended it for any professional that has to deal with confrontation or needs to be assertive for work.  I felt very much not like myself on it.

The doctor originally prescribed 10 mg but the dry mouth symptom became so bad that I reduced the dosage to 5 mg.  Lexipro helped with the anxiety and anger episodes, but at times, I felt manic. After taking the drug 6 months, the dry mouth, weight gain of mostly belly fat of 20 lbs, tiredness, absolutely no libido and no orgasms, and trouble sleeping has forced me to stop the medicine as of a week ago.  I am feeling on edge now as a result of stopping the drug, but I am hoping the withdrawal symptoms will subside and I will eventually start dropping some of the weight. I am going to try dealing with the anxiety using natural methods including diet and more exercise when my overtime work hours finally slow down.

Lexapro has 1  part to it and it comes from Celexa.  Celexa has 2 parts to it and I needed that extra part that Lexapro didn't have and that in which helps more with anxiety.  Lexapro made me soooo tired.  I gained weight and didn't want to do anything.  Lethargic.  At first it worked great but quickly went to laying around all the time and not feeling motivated.  It's hard to get adjusted to and takes time.  Give yourself time and be patient. It did have some sexual sides effects but when my doctor put me on Wellbutrin it offset that side effect and I was back to having orgasms but I couldnt take the weight gain and tired feeling.  I am on Celexa now and its works GREAT for anxiety and I've lost the weight! But I am having some sexual side effects.  I will be patient and give it some more time.  For now this is working.

Now I sweat less, my face flushes less, I can think clearer when under stress and I don't get in fits of rage as I used to w/o it. The down side of this drug is that while it eliminates the worst end of the spectrum of my mood it also takes away the tip top feeling of joy at the extreme other end of the spectrum of my mood. And lastly, when I have attempted to wean myself off of this drug the side effects are so overbearing and uncomfortable that I have just had to accept that I will be taking this drug for as long as I live as the side effects lingered as long as 4 weeks when I tried to get off of it. Brain zaps, disorientation, inability to think clearly, anxiety, irritability, rage, clumsiness & weight gain were all the symptoms I continuously experienced when I stopped taking this drug.

I have cut my dosage in half, and if I know I am going to have a stress filled day, I take the entire dosage.  I have to take it mid-day because I have found if taken in the morning, then mid afternoon I feel exhausted to the point I can't keep my eyes open.  If I take it at night, I don't seem to wakeup in the morning.  So about 3pm is working best for me. Sexually I had issues for about 6 weeks, but those have resolved.

Anxiety while driving, can't catch my breath, palpitations. My doctor prescribed lexapro 10mg once a day and xanax 0.25 when needed to get through the transition. I have been on Zoloft for several years but have beeen off since 2003. So I knew what to expect as far as starting and possible side effects. I took one dose of Lexapro and had a pretty much sleepless night, hot flashing, anxious. Felt like crap the next day and slept on and off for most of it. Needless to say, since I am not totally debilitated by the anxiety at this point, I decided to not continue with the lexapro and only take the xanax if the heart palpitations get out of control. I think I'll stick to the accupuncture I started, regular excercise and eating healthier and see if that works :)This is just my experience and maybe I didn't give it a fair shot but its hard to deaal with side effects of starting a med when you have a fulltime job and you're the bread and butter of the household.

I will write more later, my ratings might change. I have had Generalized panic and anxiety for a long time, off and on. But somethings have happened to our family and financial problems had put me in a tailspin since Nov. Even tho, I have found some relief with Xanax (half tab of low dosage as needed) anxiety was still coming back. Shaking feeling, sick to stomach, aches and pains, headaches, heart beating fast. I did find out I have a gall bladder that is not working,so that was part of stomach problem. Anyway, I started on 5 mg. of generic to work way up to 10, which I will take tonight. I started taking pill in am. First day hour later, dizzy and thumb twitching (it did stop) and felt sick all day. Next couple of days, burst of engery then a let down feeling. Sick to stomach. Went to work, I cut hair, but felt off. Lots of leg and arm, shoulder pain. I walked a couple of days, felt ok. Then Sunday and Monday, sick, sick, stomach, pain in joints. Called Dr. We think I take Crestor for Chelstrol, that might be causing some joint pain that is making me worry and anxious, too. She said to stop Crestor, and pain is less. I took 5 mg. last night, slept ok, then this am, little light headed and sick, sick to stomach barely could eat. I take Zantac for stomach. Went to work, by afternoon, felt better. Some reason, on this pill I am sick in am, but better in pm. Tonight I am going to take the 10 mg. Wish me luck! I switch from Day to night, bc last few days, felt so tired and yawning. If the 10 mg. makes me jittery at first, will switch to am again. I am also trying to do relax techniques, reading postive things, trying to stay busy and rest also. No sleep problems on this pill. Mostly stomach acid and pain is biggest complaint. Also at times feeling more anxious. I am going to try and give this a months try to see if it helps. I do have slight muscle jerk in knees and finger. Just now and then. I pray it helps me

I have never been depressed in my life but was prescribed primarily an antidepressant.  SSRI’s like Lexapro are like old phone cameras. Yes they can take pictures (treat anxiety), but their primary use is making phone calls (treating depression). Benzodiazepines on the other hand are your true high quality 5, 10, 15 megapixels dedicated digital cameras (only for anxiety).  For nearly 4 years I have taken Lexapro with little to no benefit.  I have gained 25lbs despite being healthy and active and my sex drive has diminished substantially.  About 3 weeks ago I decided to quit Lexapro and my doctor put me on .5mg of Clonazipam 2x per day.  WOW I have regained my sanity and nerves.  It really calms me down in just about 20-35 min and relaxes me for about 8hrs.  Oh yeah the sex is much better already too. I am still working on the extra weight. Bottom line is if your problem is anxiety, take the dedicated medication for it. Benzo’s will work in minutes, not like SSRI’s that work in weeks if at all. This with therapy and counseling should do the trick. Hope this helps and good luck to all!

For me, it also numbed my other emmotions (including happiness and sexual response). When I had children the joy was lessened by about 50%. I could have felt more happy for myself but I was too numb (10mg per day).  At the same time, the trade off can be worth it for some people (20mg per day and the anxiety was blessedly gone).  Effectiveness was quick (within one or two weeks), however has decreased over time but is still effective (probably 60-70% as effective at 7 years compared to first few months).  Lexapro also helps with the times I am angry or impatient toward my children and husband.

This would include having hot flashes, blushing.. and headaches. The first two weeks of taking lexapro I was nauseated, dizzy, couldnt sleep and no appetite. I was constantly yawning.. it does something to that area of your brain.. I wasnt tired.. but still couldnt stop yawning all the time. The medication worked well for turning off the voices and the over analyzing I was doing. I decided to go off the med in December deciding it wasnt worth being on when I go to have a baby. I had a horrible experience: really nauseas, headaches.. really bad anxiety.. irritable. . then I ended up having a cronic migraine and went to the ER not beging able to talk or see. SCARY! If you plan on going off lexapro before any big event in your life.. i.e pregnancy.. give yourself a lot of time to wean off.. its AWFUL! I was at my wits end with the way I was feeling.. and contimplated going back on just to make it stop.. Im so glad I'm not off the drug and feeling back to normal.. anxiety free!  If you plan on taking this medication for a long period of time thats fine...but for the short-term.. think twice.. I would suggest seeking therapy instead!

I take 10 mg every morning. Initial symptoms (increased anxiety, irritability, sleepiness and sweating) have disappeared after a week. I can feel my anxiety subsiding after 5 days, and I feel ""normal"" after two weeks of being on the medication. 

The first time I took this was after the birth of my daughter (I was breastfeeding, and the doctor determined it was safe). I weaned off after four months (from 10 to 5 to 2.5) and had no issues. I am taking it again because of some stress in my life that triggered panic attacks.

The initial side effects are difficult to go through, and sometimes it feels like it's not working (or you want to give up) but I encourage you to stick it out. Once it starts to work, you will be so glad you did.

Coaches reported he seemed more relaxed but at home he seemed to no longer care about anything, or anyone. Personality change, lost all empathy,became mean, agressive, and violent. Side effects included extreme fatigue, which made anxiety and depression worse, weight gain, agitation, dizziness, light-headed, tingling. Couldn't get up for school, confrontational with teachers, GPA drop from 3.989 to 2.929. Weaned off over 1 month, immediate improvement but personality changes still remain to some degree. Devastating effects on entire family and almost destroyed our business at same time. Drs should not prescribe to youth and should be more aware of physical and mental side-affects and provide more warnings.  We force our kids to keep taking when they complain because Dr says to. I'm thankful we didn't end up with violent or suicidal actions. I'd rather deal with the original problems vs just covering them up and dealing with the even worse side-affects.

982$Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$7/1/2011 12:03:29 AM$Reviewer: maryljs, 45-54 Female  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $3$3$5$"I was given samples of this back in 2007 due to my chronic illness.  It made me feel relaxed, just mellow with no other side effects.  

More recent, I was given this again by another healthcare provider to manage the strees and anxiety that I was experiencing which may be contributer to my recent high blood pressure.  

I took it for three days at first.  It was horrendous.  I couldn't sleep and awful dreams as well as irritable.  I left them alone for two months.  I believe that the formula has been changed drastically.  It is just different.  

Recently, I've felt like I needed something, so started back taking them again, this time everyday. 

I makes me feel better.  Heck I'm basically loopy for the first couple of hours after I take it and off and on for the rest of the night.  

I wouldn't advise taking this in the daytime.  I'd wait for bedtime or when you knew you weren't going out anywhere.  It will make you dizzy, loopy and sleepy.    

It helps me, but just be cautious as with any drug.   "

After two days I had trouble breathing. I was told this would go away but it got worse. I was taken off the drug and still have breathing problems. My doctor says it effects the hypothalamus and it may take some time for my brain to reprogram. It's been very scary and I have found out that all these drugs can cause breathing problems.

After 2 years of talk therapy and no improvement in my constant high anxiety, I agreed to see a psychiatrist. I thought he'd give me something like Xanax. He recommended Lexapro and I was initially extremely reluctant to get on a long-term drug. I finally agreed and am SO glad that I did. After only about 2 weeks, I already began to feel so much better. It's as if the background noise in my brain stopped and I could think clearly again. I took it for 9 months and was feeling so much better I decided to stop (without consulting my doc). Bad choice. Within 5 months I was an anxious, irritable mess again and went back on. Also upped my dosage from 20 mg to 30 mg. I've been back on for 4 months and am again feeling amazing, able to cope with daily life, keep things in perspective and I feel happy! I would highly recommend Lexapro to anyone who is suffering with anxiety that interferes with your daily life.

Afterwards the medication worked very well for me. I started out at 10mg and am now taking 20mg. I went from having an anxiety attack every other day to about once a month. A few side effects, is insomnia, I had issues with sleeping before, but now its next to impossible to get a full nights sleep. I also have a decrease in my sex drive. All together I would much rather have those issues than have attacks! My depression is also well managed, Lexapro is really giving me a helping hand in getting back to a ""normal"" life."

I've had good luck with prozac in the past. After months of severe anxiety (years without meds), I finally went to the doctor. I told him I wanted prozac though he recommended lexapro. I started with 10mg daily, in the evening. My anxiety level was higher than ever. 10 days later I went to 20mg with no positive results. After a month with lexapro, I have now switched to prozac. As soon as I weened myself off of lexapro (no prozac), my anxiety went away completely. I am also going through counseling, to rid myself of the anxiety for good. These drugs are like putting a band-aid on a gaping wound. Therapy is the best way to learn to deal with things, hands down. The biggest reason I wanted to go with prozac is the price and how it worked for me in the past. A 30 day supply of lexapro is $35, while a 90 day supply of prozac is $10. Still, lexapro did nothing positive for me at all, even though my dosage was too low for anxiety. I also have a supply of xanax (.5mg)and use it sparingly. Get counseling!!!"

I was having a hard time concentrating on the LSAT, so the doctor prescribed Lexapro for test anxiety. That didn't help. The only think I noticed was that it was easier to get to sleep at night, but then I would became too sleepy and have a hard time waking up. I was also prescribed Adderall for concentration, which has been the only thing that really helps. Unfortunately, the anxiety was still there. It did help with my moodiness, and I even took an extra dose during my period to help with my PMDD. I don't recommend this for people with high anxiety, but it did seem to help balance out my mood levels.

I started on 10 mg for 5 years, and although , i was relulctant to increase dose to 20 mg in 2008 I did so , due to increased anxiety, It took a while to get adjusted to the 20 mg , but once I did , its seemed to help reduce the amount of anxiety and worry.  I seem to have ADD also, but that could also be caused from the Anxiety. I hate to be on Lexparo for the rest of my life, but it seems that might be the case. As others have said, its seems to be about the best SRRI out there.  Any one gone above the 20 mg dose?

I am an RN and it concerns me to add more medications to what I am currently taking. I have adverse side effects from many medications and with this mostly all of the antidepressive/anxiety medications that my physician has tried over the last 11 years.  I am currently taking only adderal and clonazepam for my depression and anxiety; the adderal I know is not a conventional tx, but due to my sensitivities to it has proved to be a good option. I have developed increasing episodes of anxiety and difficulty with concentration when I am anywhere but at work. I've resisted adding any further medications for quite sometime, but can no longer do that as I don't want s/s to manifest themselves when I am at work. I agreed to try Lexapro as it is 1 that I had not tried yet.  I have only been taking 5mg at bedtime for about 2 weeks now. I don't think that there has been any changes yet. I know that a true trial will require more time on the medication. So far, I have noticed no side effects. Why can a person not regain the seratonin that is reportedly lost with depression?? If your blood count is low or blood chemistry is off it can be replaced.  Why not seratonin?? I would like to not be taking any medications at some time in my life. What is on the horizon in the treatment of depression?? I want to get off medications.  I am otherwise healthy.  Technical and rock climb, back country backpack, hike, and other outdoor activities.

I did, but with the same results...pins and needles.  I stopped again but then started a month or so later only to have pins and needles again.  I stayed on Lexapro for about another 2-3 months.  I used Percocet to help control the pins and needles.  Those two drugs became my daily ritual.  However, I moved from Lexapro to Xanax and found a lot more relief while still using the Percocet.  Later, I also developed burning sensations.  I now have all three--pins, needles, and burning sensations (PNBS), a new acronym.  I have tried incessantly to get rid of these problems, but still have them.  I basically live on oxycodone (Percocet without the Tylenol) at least 3-5 times a week with an occasional Xanax.  I've tried every herbal known to man with little success.  I contacted the makers of Lexapro to ask for a solution, but their cop-out was that my doctor would have to treat me and that they could do nothing.  Now I see why people sue pharmaceutical companies.  Good luck on Lexapro.  But, if you experience PNBA right away, my advice is to stop it immediately and never return.  The PNBA is horrible!

This medicine has made my moods much more stable, and I am much more calm- I still get anxious, but I feel on lexapro I am better able to cope with it. I feel happier, and I have little more energy. Also an unexpected result, I suffer from chronic neck pain, but it's been completely gone since taking lexapro! I've read studies on antidepressants treating pain, and I guess that's what happened!

I was having major panic attacks and was prescribed Paxil.  After 2 yrs on Paxil I was dead inside.  I felt like a zombie and had sexual side effects.  I decided to stop taking it and after a few months I was feeling those old feelings creep up again.  My new Dr. started me on Lexapro 10mg.  What a difference.  I had no sexual side effects and actually lost a few pounds.  I evenutally moved up to 20 mg but have recently been taking biodentical hormones and that has enabled me to go back to 10 and hopefully to 5 soon.  I believe that middle age women should have their hormone levels checked because I never experienced these symptoms till the ""change"" started.  "

I would feel like I wasn't in control of my body and would put myself into many panic attacks. I had to go to the emergency room several times thinking that I couldnt breath and eventually put myself into a depression. I wouldnt leave my house for 2 weeks and if I did I just felt abnormal and like I was walking on clouds. I new something was wrong and my doctor prescribed me lexapro 10mg. It only took about 1 week to kick in and I felt a little zombie like at first put a couple weeks after that I have never felt so great! Lexapro is a life saver haha :) !! P.s It's a little on the expensive side so my doctor prescribes me 20mg's which you can cut in half and it will last you 2 months instead of just one.

It totally changed my life for the best. But, like an idiot I thought that I needed to come off it to prove that I could overcome the anxiety and did it right after I got laid off. Bad idea, because it rebounded hard and threw me back into a tailspin. Fortunately, the initial relief comes within a week or so for me and I had a leftover bottle from March that I started myself back on. It's a good thing too because I could definitely feel things starting to slip away again. I can honestly say I'm going to be on it and stay on it for a while now while I work on handling stress better and not worrying about the great unknown.

I had multiple fainting spells the first week I was on it. It makes me dehydrated to the point that my limbs tremble uncontrollably. I was drinking 4 liters of water a day and was constantly thirsty with a dry mouth. I went several weeks where I had INTENSE panic attacks, worse than I'd ever had before, upon waking up. I was constantly tired, often sleeping 18+ hours per day. My doctor was convinced I had mono, that it wasn't the Lexapro that was making me so exhausted, and refused to take me off until I had been on it for 6 months. Now I'm switching to Celexa, and I'm terrified of the side effects. My experience with Lexapro was the worst 6 months of my life.

Lexapro has completly changed my life for the good!

I take 10mg each day. Upon starting the medication, I did vomit the first day and then felt nauseous each morning for about the first week. After that all nausea feelings went away.

The 2 major side effects that I suffer most from with this medication are increased persperation and problems ejaculating. I sometimes have twitches, but usually right after I wake up. Sometimes concentrating is hard, especially when multi-tasking. Occasionally, I experience forgetfullness like walking into a room to get something and not remembering what it was when I get there.

I have not experienced any issues with weiht gain, regular nausea, or night sweats. I actually feel that I get a better nights sleep since I have been using Lexapro. As mentioned, my persperation level has increased especially when I am active. (sports, exercising, etc.). Ejaculation has been prolonged and sometimes never, since I have started usage.
It does not seem that alcohol consumption  intensifies the effect, but I only drink socially. 

My doctor said this would be the best medication for a person in my age group with the least amount of side effects and referred to it as a ""chill pill"". Things that use to irritate me, seem to not bother me at all now. It just rolls right down my back.

Prior to taking my first dose I read the reviews here on Web Md, and was a little hesitant and even scared about taking it. After the nausea and sick feeling I wanted to stop after the first few days and stuck it out. Give it time to get into your system and start working. It only took a week for me. Everyone around me that knows I take it can see a differnce in my personality. I went for about 3 years before I spoke with my doctor about anxiety issues. I could not imagine living like I previously did. Lexapro is the best!!! Highly recommend!"

I had an episode where my heart was pounding and I was twitching and experiencing black outs and having to use the restroom frequently.  Before this all started I thought the drug was helping. I know these side effects are rare but for someone who is taking this for anxiety and have this happen increases anxiety issues greatly, and now makes me afraid to take any other medications.  I hope this medication helps you and you do not have a bad reaction, I just advise you to know all of the possible side effects before taking this drug.

It has been a HUGE help with the anxiety and i have no depression anymore! I was taking effexor which helped some but after a year of use, the Effexor no longer helped! I have been on Lexapro for 2 yr.s now and it still has the same effect! I have had some symptoms though. A huge decrease in sexual drive is interfering with my relationship! I'm torn on what is more important, my sanity or my relationship! Its 50/50. I am not able to funtion properly with out it!

First of all, it makes my heart race really fast which just cant be good. It gives me an overall feeling of being more anxious not less. No weight gain, decrease in sex drive and difficulty having orgasms have been some of the side effects that I have experienced. I also had some really vivid strange dreams and typically I don't remember my dreams at all. I take 5mg once a day.

I was diagnosed and treated with Lexapro in 2003. It has changed my life. I was only able to hold down a job for the most three years...mood swings would effect my preformance at work relationships as well as my personal relationships. Lexapro helped me think clearer and with less emotion. My life would have been profoundly different if I had been given Lexapro earlier in my life. I feel calm level headed and never agonize over how I have acted. The only side effects that might be going on is that I am much quieter. I feel my short term memory could be effected as well as a slowed response to recalling information.

I was having severe stress with my job and was having a hard time coping with every day events. My temper was quick and I always seemed to be mad or in a bad mood. After taking this medicine for 1 week I noticed a complete change. I was not irritated by all life's little problems. My mood was much better also. My wife has noticed a great change in my demeanor also and doesn't want me to get off the medicine ever. The only side effect I have noticed was a decrease in libido. I have a difficult time reaching orgasm during sex and my sex drive seems to be way down, which my wife is enjoying. Overall, this has been a wonderful drug that has helped me cope with my job and life again. The side effects were worth the peace of mind I have now.

During the days on this medication I couldn't go without a nap. I was almost constantly yawning and couldn't focus on anything.

Stopped each because of head zaps and dizzyness. I've been on Lexapro 10 mg for almost 5 months.  The only side effect is insominia.  I turn out the light at 11:00 at lay awake until 1 or 2 - which is a distraction at work.  also have night sweats but that could be due to menopause.  I would recomment Lexapro above Zoloft and Paxil but i'm really not certain that it is helping be that much.  I feel okay - but still have anxiety at the thought of traveling, vacations or doing anything out of my routine.  I'm still not thrilled over anything in life and don't have any great highs - but no great lows either.  All and all - i don't know what i think.  I know before taking Lexapro i decided that once i started, i would not stop.  The withdrawls from Paxil and Zoloft were both very debilitating and i'm afraid to go through that again.   I will stay with Lexapro - and hope i continue to do better and feel more interested and excited about life.  Good luck to you too.

I love this medication it has change my life for the best and I don't ever plan on going off of it unless my insurance makes me. My insurance would not cover this drug for about 6 months and I went off and changed to Zoloft and another drug that were totally ineffective. That time I had no real side effects either that I could blame on Lexapro.

I stopped taking it because I could not handle the sexual side effects.  Then when my doctor prescribed it again he told me that it should ALWAYS be taken at night!!! It helps with the drowsiness, which was my 1st problem because I felt like a zombie in the morning when I took it.  So when I started taking it at night, I noticed that I STARTED TO HAVE ORGASMS RIGHT AWAY!! Now I take it before bed every night, and I have orgasms all the time!

Lexapro has worked very effectively but I've had side effects which have caused me to stop the drug twice. On Lexapro mood is very even with feelings  of just not being bothered about anything - this ""lack"" of emotion means sadness/anxiety is gone but I sometimes missed ""feeling"" things. Also found it difficult to motivate myself for work as the stress went.Worst side effect for me was weight gain (20-30lbs)- I probably started eating more but didn't really notice at the time. For me Lexapro becomes effective within a few days and the two times I've stopped sad and anxious feelings have come back within a few weeks. The drug has been most effective and if it wasn't for the weight gain I'd probably still be taking it."

I am tired of the sexual side effect of decreased drive, orgasm, and erection. Otherwise this is a great med.

1850$Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$12/1/2009 3:03:21 PM$Reviewer: AnxiousNurse, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$"When I first started taking this med I didn't know if I could tolerate it.  I was VERY anxious for the first few weeks, probably more so than why I even got on it.  My pdoc wanted me to take ativan 2-3 times daily to get thru the early period of adjusting to this med, and I am really glad I weathered the storm.  I am more level headed, can handle the day-to-day more easily, do not jump the gun and start yelling at people for no reason, and no longer suffer from random anxiety attacks on a daily basis.  My PMS is almost non-existent, whereas before my husband would take cover for 7-10 days before my period.  I truly would have headed for the hills far away from this med had my doctor not warned me about the start-up side effects.  Some people may not have them, but if you are like me and notice EVERY LITTLE THING that changes in you body and mind, you may be more sensitive to these types of meds and it may just freak you out.  Nothing a little scheduled ativan can't handle.  Thankfully my doc trusted me to take this, as I know other docs won't prescribe it for their patients.  I don't know how else I would have made it through the first 2-3 weeks.  Now I almost never have to take the ativan, because when I do get anxiety it is mild and I can talk myself off the edge of insanity pretty easily unlike before when I would just freak out immediately.  I do have a decreased libido but Lexapro comes with a built-in ""I don't give a crap"" mentality for so many things, including your reaction to the minor side effects you may have to live with.  And it's not ""I don't care I'm a zombie"" it's ""I'm not going to take that too seriously"".  BTW I only take 7.5 mg because 10 mg made my muscles twitch for some reason, but it seems to still work great.  Good luck!"

When I woke the next morning I ran for a glass of water and some coffee as I still felt out of it being a mother of two this was not working for me. I could not sit still! I grabbed my kids and we took off walking,calling grandma to come get my kids on the way out the door knowing I was not able to focus.I just walked, I couldn't even focus on words to speak. I walked for 5 hours non stop until I got my husband to take me to the er. Turns out I was having a panic attack which is a side effect of this med. they had to give me a shot of Ativan just to get me to calm down. When I finally dropped on the bed in the er my thighs were on fire and I was ready to pass out..still that night having strange feelings and trouble sleeping.

I didnt want to be on medication every day. But i also couldnt live with the constant (what I call) heart dropping feeling. It was taking over my life. The first few weeks def. took some getting used to. But after being on Lexapro for over 4 months I feel like my old self (which has been soo long since i've seen).
1901$Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$11/9/2009 2:39:22 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$Let me first say that for the first 2 weeks, I wanted OFF this, but after a lifetime of no med working 4 my depression/anxiety, I'm SO glad I didn't! I haven't been able to work out of the home for the last 3 years because of my depression/anxiety/add/pmdd) so was able to take the time to adjust. The 1st couple of days I thought I was losing my mind. I'd be crying for ten minutes, then extremely agitated for ten, then ok for ten - press repeat.  Essentially, 1st two weeks didn't feel at all like myself & had severe nausea, sleep problems, you name it including suicidal thoughts (try not to be alone, although I had to). But after having tried no kidding EVERY other drug out there just about with no luck, I was desperate & hung in there, just hoping. 2-3 months into taking 10mg I WAS noticing some improvement but not enough with my anxiety, so my doctor upped me to 20mg. So I had a repeat of the two weeks of hell - after a couple of weeks it was bearable but still wasn't myself for a couple more. Now, while I do still have to fight the depression, at least I feel I can. I can actually usually choose my reactions to stress instead of my reactions choosing me, have spent more time out of bed and actually able to function when my PMDD isn't kicking my butt ten days a month around my period (any suggestions for this?), & have been able to cope MUCH better. BTW, just some of the other drugs I tried (and yes, did give them at least a month or two - didn't have the severe side effects as with the Lexapro, just zombied out): Paxil (never again!), Prozac, Zoloft, Effexor ... there were more I can't remember off-hand, including ones for anxiety/panic attacks.  It had gotten to where I didn't believe in the meds at all before trying the Lex.  Now I wish I'd hung in there before & kept trying until I found one that worked for me. Could have maybe saved me years of grief and a messed-up life. Anyway, REALLY grateful for this drug! Hang in there all & keep trying!

Although, my severe mood swings and anxiety had all but vanished, I was very unhappy with the weight gain. After almost a year of taking the drug, I wanted off. I quit taking it on my own. The first day was okay. The second day was a nightmare. I got a painful cramp in my upper back and arm. It felt like what I thought a heart attack might feel like, and then the shocks or the buzz. I had moments of staring and not being able to break my gaze. I was lucky I didn't throw them away. I started taking them again and all the withdrawal episodes went away. I had to have medical guidance from my Internal Medicine Doctor to get off the med. After all that, I still think using the Lexapro was worth it, because it did help me. I just couldn't live with the weight gain. I guess I would rather be moody and anxiety ridden then overweight.

I am only on my first week but my vision is fine and I don’t feel “spacey” anymore. My appetite is less, but I am okay with that. I don’t know about sexual side effects, but my Dr. told me that she is on it and the first month she had difficulty reaching climax, but then after the first month, it was better!

I feel like ""me"" but without the edge and anxiety I always felt. My husband and kids noticed right away that I wasnt snippy, didn't yell as much, was calmer and smiled more. I feel like I enjoy life again without stressing so much. I began taking Lexapro due to my father dying, then my cousin and then my husband being deployed all within a few months. It has helped me calm down and cope with life, rather than being so angry. Only negative side affects is loss of appetite (which I'm okay with!) some strange dreams, but sleep ok so far and sometimes tiredness about 2-hours after taking my pill (10mg) but then I'm fine after that. I am excited to have my life back again and am hopeful to feel even better over time. I've been on this now for only a week so results for me were almost immediate!"

The drug has worked tremendously to keep my anxiety under control.  However last week I started a new job for the first time in 28 years and my anxiety returned with a vengeance.  Lexapro is more of a preventitive medication and it did not control my increased anxiety because of the new job.  My doctor prescribed .5mg of Xanax to try and get the anxiety under control.  The Xanax seems to be working however my concern now is if the anxiety will continue to return when starting a new job.  I had to be let go from this recent new job because if was a computer programmin contractor's job and the client did not want to have to deal with my anxiety issues.  So now I will again be looking for a new job and my fear is that the anxiety will return in spite of now taking Xanax.  Has anyone out there experienced this same situation?

I feel that it evens me out and I no longer worry about the small stuff.  You need to give this medicine at least 6 weeks to give your body time to adjust.  I felt a little weird at first.  I experienced several side effects the first month (mainly waking up in the middle of the night with a rapid heart rate), but it gradually became less frequent & disappeared.  It also makes you a little tired at times if you cut your sleep short.  If I get a good 7-8 hours of sleep each night, I feel energized most days.  I resisted the urge to stop taking this medicine during the first month with the support of my wife and lots of prayers and the payoff was well worthwhile to me.  I am very glad I stuck with it through the initial body adjustment, though it was tough at times.  I finally feel like my normal self again.

My doctor said the anxiety attacks was my body's way of telling me something was wrong. He first tried me on venlafaxine(generic Celexa) but they made me so sick with just one dose that I couldn't take them. He switched me to Lexapro and at first I was still having problems but what I didn't realize was that you have to give these medicines time to work. It's been a couple of weeks and I'm definetly feeling better. I would recommend Lexapro for it's ease of use and it's lack of side effects. For me anyway there where no side effects.

I was astounded at the improvement in my mental state within the first 10-14 days.  I realize now how much anxiety and depression was impacting my life.  I no longer feel 'bedeviled' by negative thoughts, anger, helplessness or other repetitive thoughts which really controlled my ability to function optimally.  During this time I also passed thru menopause; and either that or the lexapro may be to blame for decreased memory (short term) and slight weight gain.  Regardless, the improvement on Lexapro has been significant enough (as noted by my family as well) to be well worth memory loss or wt. gain; if indeed it is to blame.  I should also say the anxiety issues are genetic; my mothers family displaying the same type of behaviors I have personally experienced throughout my adolescence and adult life.  I am now 54 and retired from 32 years full time healthcare management (originally RN).

(Took 10mg daily.) I was having some moderate depression and anxiety associated with worry about kids and parents and getting older and did feel better after a month or two.  Was also working with a therapist.  I might have had some sexual side effects and mild weight gain but it's really hard to know whether those were from the drug or the mental condition.  I went off cold turkey four months later as I was feeling better and didn't have any withdrawal effects.  Was it the meds?  Therapy?  Onset of the cheery spring season?  Bad thoughts just coming and going?  Impossible to say.  Might need to go back on if symptoms return. Would rather just take Xanax as I know that works but can't be on that long term.

Took the first one yesterday - and while I was okay for the most part, I just felt strange -- probably a bit anxious.  I also take Xanax (particularly for headaches since it's the only thing that works), and the doctor said to take 2/day along with the lexapro.

Stress and increased post-menopausal symptoms are my primary issues right now.  Based on everything I've ready, I'm very leary about taking Lexapro.  In fact, I did not take it today.  Unfortunately, I transferred into a department where I thought opportunities would be better and a healthier work environment, but it's the total opposite.  So, it's multiple issues that have accumulated over time, and everyone has their limit.

I will call the doctor tomorrow and see if 5mg a day (or every other day) would be worth a try.  Maybe the 10mg is just too much for me.

I'm a very active person and must be able to function at work every day -- not so sure this stuff will improve my ability to do the things I need to do..."

2386$Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$6/2/2009 1:35:39 AM$Reviewer: EmoBoi, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$"I have been on lexapro for about a month or so (or anxiety) the 5mg I'm pretty sure. The first day was easy going for never being on medication like this before. No side effects other then dry mouth and slightly lightened colors (that was confusing). Although, about a week or two later, I started to get very extreme dreams,something like being Ironman. Anyways, The first day was like a miracle compared to the day before ridden with full of anxiety, and nervous moments. 
I'm not 100% sure if I personally want to continue with this just because of the dreams,and inability to orgasm easily anymore. I do recommend that it is taken at night, it totally knocks me out, sleep fairly well till the dreams. But over all, after hearing things about other drugs of this type, This has been a very good experience for a first-timer such as myself  :) "

I have taken just about every anti-depressant there is and hated the way they made me feel and LOOK. When I was on Paxil, I gained about 15-20 lbs and I am a slim, small-boned person. I was not eating more, so I could not figure out why this was happening. Anyway, I weaned off Paxil and was on nothing for a while. I was going through a very difficult time personally. Then the flu-like symptoms of fibro returned as well as depression and anxiety. I discussed this with a psychiatrist and asked to be put on Lexapro (recommended to me). She said that would be a good choice for me as it is ""weight neutral."" I have been on Lexapro 40mg for about 3 years and it has been a good choice for me. After reading some of the reviews, I wonder if I should be taking Lexapro at night instead of in the morning. My fatigue level is high most of the time. Now I am thinking it may be due, in part, to the Lexapro."

My dr put me on lexapro, and it worked immediately! I had some tingling the first time I took it, which was weird, so I cut it in half and took 5mg instead of 10. It is May, and I started taking it November 5, and I have had 1 panic attack since. There is a downfall...in these 6 months I have gained 22lbs without changing any of my eating habits and I cannot get it off. I've been on a 1200 calorie low fat diet for about three weeks with exercise and NO CHEATING. I have gained 2 lbs. Now I am more miserable than I was before. I would definitely advise you to try something else first. Only use lexapro as your last resort. I am currently weaning off of it, and I have been dizzy, irritable, and had lots of headaches. This is from only taking 5mg!! Please be careful, and check out all these medications before you start taking them.

I got put on it for Generalized Anxiety Disorder. I would get anxious and constantly worry about EVERYTHING. I would have a panic attack every other day and it was controlling my life. I couldn't control my worrying anymore, when at one time I thought I could. Even though it's only been 2 weeks, I feel a difference. I'm not getting stressed over the small stuff or even yelling at someone for no reason, and I have not had a panic attack -YAY!!!. I feel more like myself again with no side effects. When I first started taking it, I had a loss of appetite, I felt nauseated, and I felt really zoned out, but these passed within a couple of days.

This medication WILL work for you, but you have to give it time.  In the beginning, I experienced chills, increased anxiety, and nausia.  These side effects will go away after the first few weeks.  It is worth it to ride through the rough few weeks because this medication has especially helped me with anxiety.  I would say that after 3 months, you will really begin to see the full benefit of the medication.  I gained a few pounds, but with exercise and diet, you can maintain normal weight.  Having a good support system around is a very crucial part to feeling better as well.  Hope this helps you and, feel better!!

I don't care if the house work gets done, bills get paid, clothes get washed etc, I just don't care.  I went on a diet soon after starting the drug--I lost 75 pounds in 5 months.  It was not the drug that helped me lose the weight,  I believe the drug helped me stop obsessing about things--food included--and that was what finally helped me lose weight.  Did have sexual side effects, dry mouth (which improved after a few weeks) and some difficulty sleeping.  Unfortunately my insurance will no longer pay and doc wants to switch me to Celexa.  I am super paranoid about gaining weight on Celexa (although weight gain is often a side effect of Lexapro, too) and as I stated before, Lexapro did not make me gain weight.  I am hoping for the best as I switch to Celexa.  FYI--my doc said Lexapro is an improved version of Celexa.  Lexapro is escitalopram and Celexa is scitalopram, so again, I am hoping for the best in my experience with Celexa.

When I cut the pill in half or skipped a day, the anger would simmer down. I started taking half a pill a day about two months ago and that seems to work okay. Frequent bouts of worry (but not full-blown anxiety) have started it up, but I'm trying out some stress reduction techniques to help alleviate angst.

My husband and I are trying to have a baby and in order to do that, I safely weaned myself off of Lexapro.  Wow, gradual or not, the side effects were some of the worst I have ever experienced.  I have been on and off of several medications since I was 14 years old (I am 28 now) and I have never experienced withdrawal symptoms like those I did with Lexapro.  The dizziness and nausea was too much to handle. I was literally off balance for a month and my brain was constantly ""re-setting"" itself making my vision blurred, causing headaches, lack of balance and exhaustion.  I recommend to everyone to truly investigate teh side effects of this medication BEFORE you start taking it.

My chronic anxiety had started to manifest itself into irratibility.  This medicine has make a tremendous difference in my life.  My first two weeks on the medication I experienced side effects where I felt ""foggy"" headed, sleepy and I yawned a lot.  I also felt very relaxed and unconcerned which was a relief.  After that I started to wonder if the effects of the drug had worn off.  What I didn't realize is that I had stop ""blowing up"" at my family at the end of the day.  My level of anxiety and subsequent irratibility is the lowest it has been in many years.  The only side effect I experience now is a slightly reduced interest in sex.  For me, the benefits far outweigh this negative.  In my case, interest and performance are inter related.  I am 46 yo MWM.  My ability to perform is not diminished by the medicine, but my interest is.  However, when my interest is there, I can perform as any male my age can.  

I am much more relaxed and patient while taking this medication and my relationships have improved because of this.

Also, Lexapro works on BOTH sides of your brain, Celexa only on side at a time. I am so thankful for this medication, I have my life back!!! If it makes you sleepy,take it at nite.

I take 10 mg and my panic attacks are gone. Stress still exists but how I handle it is much different. I had very little side effects, just a little nausea in the beginning. I have gained no weight. I take it at night to avoid the sluggish. I exercise regularly, and I think that has also helped to give me energy etc. I would recommend this product.

I had already lost my mother several years before. It did help with the depression/anxiety but have been on so long, it seems I am immune now. I did, however have bouts of ""breakthrough anxiety"" in which I had to be prescribed Xanax to calm down. I was on the verge of a nervous breakdown though and the Lexapro and Xanax kept me from losing it. My doctor has now prescribe me Effexor as a change to  see if that will help since some of my original symptoms are coming back. "

I never wanted to kill myself, but the anxiety was so bad for me that I wasn't sure I wanted to keep living in spite of my wonderful wife and son. 4 days after starting on these medications I felt like me again. The initial side effects were a bit tough, but stick with it. I have had NO loss of libido. Some delay in ejaculation, but orgasms are 100% more satisfying! I can't say how much I appreciate feeling like me again. I still feel tired a lot, I think that's from the Seroquel more than the Lexapro. I see my psych on Monday and am going to see about discontinuing the Seroquel and going with just the Lexapro.

That was last November and I started having terrible panic attacks in the middle of Feb this year.  I decided to go back on lexapro only 5 mg to get used to it.  At first it really helped me but I still have panic attacks.  They make me feel crazier.  I am not depresssed I just have anxiety. I have never been more tired.  I want to work out but my heart beats so rapidly that I am afraid to.  Sometimes it feels fluttery.  I get dizzy and it sometimes feels like im falling.  My ears ring, Im constipated, I still get anxious.  I feel spacey. I'll be mid-sentence and pause then kinda forget what I was saying.  I eat constantly and I get shaky and sweaty.  I also don't feel anything.  I just want God to help me with this, I don't want to be on anything anymore.  I've decided to ween myself off.

After children, removal of uterus/ovaries, I felt worn out and on edge. Everything and everyone annoyed me. My doctor suggested this medication. Wow, I feel like my old self - short temper is gone, I can laugh and those little things are no longer HUGE issues. Always a side effect in medication -- I feel hungry a lot! I have gained about 10 pounds. But as one friend told me.. ""it's worth it, you are so calm now."" A positive side effect: I take it at night and I sleep better than I ever have. I wake up feeling rested! Even with the weight gain, I'm sticking with Lexapro it truely makes my life and for those around me much better. "

My doc and I felt that I needed it for severe anxiety and major depression.  I am also taking Bupropion. My husband has terminal cancer and my mother is very ill, so the stress has been great.  After taking one pill yesterday morning, about two hours later, I had tention in my muscles, severe shaking, hightened anxiety with exhaustion, and inability to sleep past 5 hours. I had a friend come over because I was so scared. I also could not eat after I took the pill.  I cannot aford to lose any more weight.  I've already lost 25 over the last year, 15 in the last month do to stress.  I am going to take the pill again today, but not until I have a large breakfast.  I do for the first time in a year feel hungry this morning.  I will try Lexapro for one week.  If the side effects don't go away, I will stop and try something else. 
Am am really frustrated that I have to take medications, but I am also greatful that they are out there.  I guess I worry more about the long term effects more then short term.  Plus what is going into our water systems?  Two headed fish and frogs?  If it makes some of us have no labido, then what will it do to the whales?!?  We are all drinking the same water.  Maybe that is why so many people are having mental health issues in the first place!  Just thinking."

Then once I adjusted it worked great. I felt so normal. Went off the drug on own and had terrible withdrawals. I would have really bad headaches that would last for days and frequent anxiety attacks. I even stressed out so bad that I got shingles. Dr put me back on it and its been almost 2 weeks and I am starting to feel great again.

The only good thing about this medication is that I did not have withdraw side effects.  This medication made me very tired and I gained almost 20 pounds while taking it. I would suggest to anyone who is new to this medication to talk to others who have been on it before taking it.  I did not do this and wasted 6 months of taking this medication and being exhausted the entire time.

I was tired during the day and couldn't sleep at night and seemed to have panic attacks more often. I started taking Lexapro before bed along with Melatonin.

My mother also takes it and finds that taking Lexapro in the morning works for her.

I would feel very lightheaded. I was taking it in the morning though. I switched to nighttime and after about a week or two the side effects went away. So to anyone out there experiencing side effects give the medication a try for about two weeks. I was on 10mg at first and I did notice a difference. I wasn't so high strung, was able to focus so much better, and was able to deal with life in general much better. This only lasted for a couple of weeks and then I was back where I started. I went back to the doctor and he doubled the dosage to 20mg. I must say I've been taking it now for about a year and half and it is WONDERFUL for me! I am able to handle situations that I never would have been able to handle before. It also helps me with my ""monthly"" bouts of depression. If you're a female you know what I mean. I've got to be honest this has been a wonder drug for me. I realize that medication effects people differently and what's good for one person may not be good for another. But, if offered Lexapro by your physician, give it a chance. As with most other drugs you will probably experience some sort of side effects the first week or two. Thanks for letting me share and hopefully this review will be able to help someone."

Weaning off of it was a nightmare. I felt like I had the flu for 4 months.  I had to wean VERY gradually to avoid severe headaches, feeling comatose.  Though it helped me through a tough era, I must admit if had I know about the withdrawal symptoms I would never have taken it.  I'm an active, busy person and I felt miserably sick during the weaning.  If you need to wean, get appropriate advice on doing it slowly.

It does take away the anxiety, but I have a lot of side effects - my sex drive has decreased dramatically (not good for my marriage), I've gained about 15 pounds and am heavier than ever and I sweat a lot which is terribly embarrassing and annoying.  I have been going off the medicine gradually (tried going off cold turkey but that was painful - brain shocks and headaches that were scary).  Yaz has helped my mood swings and regular exercise has been great for my anxiety attacks.  I also know that eating healthy food helps me tremendously.  I'm hoping once I'm off Lexapro completely, I'll lose the excess weight and stop sweating!

Prior to starting the med, I was very stressed and close to depression. The main symptom I was experiencing was extreme muscle pain in my neck and shoulders along with tension headaches that would make me nauseous. I would also sometimes have panic-like symptoms, such as fast heart rate and sweating in some circumstances. Taking Lexapro was like NIGHT AND DAY. It made me feel less irritable, calm, and care-free without that ""flat affect"" feel of some other meds. Most of all, it reduced my muscle pain dramatically. The heavy cost of the med is completely worth it. Substitutions like Celexa (Citalopram) have side effects like weight gain and are not as effective. Lexapro is a great option for those that are physically stressed and need a pill to feel normal again. I stopped taking Lexapro when I felt ready (approx. 2 years later) and do not feel dependent at all. Make sure you  follow doctor's orders and wean yourself off it slowly. "

Everyone I know says ""Lexapro has changed my life - for the better!"" No sides effects to speak of for me nor my Mom. Oh, yeah - Lexapro took my Mom from Miss Negative (couldn't stand to be with her) to the Mother I had always dreamed about. I finally got a Mother I dearly love and want to be with all the time - and she's 95! She's a hoot and together - with us both on Lexapro - we have fun and giggle a lot........the way we'd always wished for. It's a miracle, without a doubt! :-) "

I tried again, taking only half the dosage for awhile and eventually moved up to the whole pill, without any trouble. And it has definitely helped me cope with the stress of life. Only other thing, I can't drink alcohol as I did before. I used to drink socially and having 2-3 drinks on a weekend was no problem. Now 1 is my limit - alcohol seems to affect me much more strongly and I don't enjoy having a drink like I used to. One more problem - sex drive decreased.  But overall, feel better and wouldn't dare stop taking it.

I don't feel overwhelmed and frustrated like I used to. And I'm also going thru a challenging time in my life and panic attacks were happening a lot more often and it's helped that immensley. I was scared of losing myself and becoming a zombie as some have mentioned can happen on antidepressants and since this is the first time I've ever taken anything for anxiety, I was really nervous. But overall I have to say, I am pleased with Lexapro. I'm glad a I switched to the lower dosage and it's true, give your body a couple weeks to adapt, and then some of the effects go away. My side effects were dialted pupils, yawning, no appetite and extreme tiredness. Because I was so tired at first I took it at night and it did help me sleep! Anyway, I am grateful for Lexapro. I feel much better and I feel like I have a handle on my emotions.

I was a knew person after I started Lexapro. You always feel happy and content nothing bothers you any more. I think it causes a little weight gain, not sure if it's the medicine or me but, I did gain a few. I'm trying to come off of it now because I feel like I may be doing better now, I will go back on it if I start doing bad again. I started having seizures this is the reason for the Lexapro
panic attacks etc. It has been about 1 week now and i'm feeing a little lite headed and emotional again.  If you decide to come off the Lexapro do it slowly and I think you'll be fine but, speak to a Doctor first. I was told you could start and stop any time no problem by a Doctor.

Due to the drowsiness the medication causes taking it at night has worked well and i still get the benefits of the medication during the day when it is needed the most!! Taking Lexapro before i go to sleep has allowed me to sleep throughout the night without waking up every few hours. i wake up at the same time every morning feeling refreshed and ready to get out of bed. i have noticed that i think more positivly and cearly throughout the day and have not experienced any anxety attacks while driving, which used to be a regular occurance!!

Ask your doctor to switch you to CITALOPRAM, which is a generic drug really similar to lexapro.

This medication made me useless. I started it on a Friday night so I had the weekend to see how I would react to it. And it was a three day weekend. I couldn't move. My brain could not talk to my body. I was essentially in bed the whole weekend. I took it on Saturday and Sunday night to give it a chance but there was still no improvement. After Sunday night, I stopped taking it and it took several days just to feel normal again. I still couldn't drive on Tuesday and missed work. I will never take it again. My grandma takes it and she does fine on it. For me, it just didn't agree with me. Take with caution.

I have now been on it for about 10 months and it has helped me immensely! I am much more calm and rational. The only side effects I had were during the first 2-3 months: one of my legs would suddenly jerk if I were lying in bed reading or watching tv. Kind of strange, but not something that would make me stop taking it. I have no side effects whatsoever now and it is truly working for me!

The combo worked great, and the klonopin worked to combat the drowsiness.  Things changed and my anxiety decided to become monogamous with mr. depression, so they upped my dose to 20mg a day (still with the klonopin).  So, it is working...but like everyone knows, these drugs take time to build up in your system, and it takes your body even longer to stop hating them and making you sick.  I am nauseous into week 3 of the increased dose, and still dizzy all the time.  But, just as I did when first prescribed, I know it will be worth it, so I will wait.

Sexual side effects- TRUE.  Zero sex drive.

Weight gain (aside from normal fluctuations or just eating like a piggy): 13 pounds in 2 and a half years total.

Note about anxiety/panic- I was suffering from 3-5 debilitating attacks a week.  Even on my cocktail of only 10 mg of Lexapro, I had ZERO.  "

Only problems have been with severe burning stomach pain which has began to subside after a couple of weeks. This med has worked better for anxiety than any other anti-anxiety med I have taken. So far it has been better than ativan (I was so out of it with even low doses on this med) and even k-pin (which seemed to make me almost psychotic at times). As long as it works, I'll never stop taking it, since it helps both my depression and anxiety.

Most people with GAD doesn't know what that feels like.  I had VIVID dreams yelling out but asleep, trying to get away from someone and kicking my husband (hee hee) It was all funny in the end.  This stopped and the tiredness began.  I was EXHAUSTED all the time could sleep 24/7.  We ran every blood work we could think of and finally came to the Lexapro.  I was taking 20mg then cut it to 10mg and slowly quit taking it.  The Fatigue went away.  I was so unhappy because I knew I would have to switch and loved Lexapro.  But if I can't get out of bed to care for my children there isn't much benefit.  I have been switched to Cymbalta.  I hope it is Lexapro without the severe fatigue.

Before I would just doze and be up several times throughout the night.  I was also nauseated.  I continued to take it, thinking that it would go away.  On the 3rd day I began to feel flushed and hot.  The only way to describe it is as though my entire body was on fire on the inside.  I literally lay on the cold floor, nude, to get some relief (which didn't help).  I called the ER who put me through to poison control.  I was told basically that what I experienced was not a reaction and there was nothing to do but wait it out.  2 years later, a teacher in my school had the same experience with burning after taking this drug for about 1 week.

There are days, a few a week, i feel great before I take the lexapro (12:30 every day) but 20 minutes after I take it, the mind goes all over the place.  It feels like you have to hold on to a rope while the wild mind gets anxiety, depressed, horrible thoughts, then fine about 4-5 hours later settles down.  Lexapro can turn on you.  I was a very stable person, went through 4 situations of severe emotional turmoil and it is taken over 9 months for the mind to subside, but I think Lexapro has only made it worse, I am scared to stop taking, but very scared every day to take.  I am in a good state of mind and can actually feel now that Lexapro can make me worse. Therapy and exercise might be better than really depending on Lexapro.

I had to slowly stop taking it because my doctor was afraid of dependency. The only side effect I had was that it make me sleepy which was okay because I took it right before bed each night. Since stopping it my anxiety attacks have come back, but I am better able to deal with them because while on the medicine I realized the things I was worrying about were not worth the effort. I am glad I took Lexapro but do not think I need it any longer. I would recommend it for any one with anxiety that is at a lost at what to do to get through it.

I was so riddled with anxiety I didn't want to continue to live that way. I have little to no anxiety now, I can laugh again and focus on things other than the ""what if's""! I have gained a lot of weight. 40-50 lbs! Partly because food is not the enemy anymore. Even with a diet and exercise I am unable to loose any of it. I have also lost my sex drive but I think it may be due to the unattractiveness of my current heavy state, not a side effect specifically. I hesitate to go off as I can feel the anxiety if I forget to take it. Do I stay on it forever? How do I cope with the anxiety with out it? How much more weight will I gain? Is being fat and unhappy better for me than being anxious and unhappy? Will I have horrible withdrawls if I wean off? these are some things I still need to find out. Anybody have answers?"

My temper and outbursts have minimized as well as my axiety.  During the first two weeks I took 1mg of Lorazepam in the evening, and 1/2mg in the morning to ease the transition into this therapy which seems to be working well.  The Lorazepam helped me to sleep at night until this medication began to work.
The most difficult side effect for me has been the morning nausea (the urge to vomit).  I discontinued the use of Lorazepam after three weeks with some insomnia and night sweats. Sexual desire has waned slightly, and arousal takes a bit longer but engaging is still as good.  I am a large man but have not experienced any weight gain but the urge to eat more frequently is there.
This therapy does work but I am not certain if this is for a lifetime.

(years of stress or hormonal imbalance, not sure) Either way I have tried to keep my mind stable.  I felt very stable before i crashed.  
I started Lexapro 10 and it was too strong, it made me scattered, hyper mentally (no physical side effects) and I couldnt complete a chore because I couldnt think straight.  Somewhere in the middle of all this I became OCD with horrible thoughts ( i think it was panic/depression setteling in) and i fought this away.  With doctors guidance, I lowered lexapro to 5 milligrams and most days seem ok, but like today, I woke up fine exersized mentally perfect.  I took lexapro same time every day and within 15 minutes It makes me feel weird, detached, cant focus, WEIRD and not a good weird.  feel horrible.  It takes a while to wear off and I take 1/2 a lorezepam to fix what the lexapro might be doing.  I am not 100% sure about lexapro or just going natural and taking a lorezepam or 1/2 a lorezepam when panic/mind racing starts to come on.  If anyone is having the same problem with lexapro, please respond in this website.  I want to try and like and stay on lexapro but it can give me really bad days after I take it.

I switched to Lex and also went to rehab at about the same time. I am now 9mo sober and still taking Lex. I believe this drug helped me through this challenge.

I was absolutely resistent to drug treatment, tryting months of alternative therapies.  After virtually no relief I finally ""caved"" and began Lexapro as part of a multi-pronged aspproach that seems to be working: I requested a role change at my job, committed to getting more sleep & eating better, started seeing a therapist, and began Lexapro @ 10mg.  It took 6 weeks for the med to work - the panic was less frequent and less intense but still needed xanax on occasion.  After 3 months, upped dose to 20mg and I am thankful at how I am WAY better than a year ago.  One noticeable side effect - I've gained 12 lbs in the last 2-3 months (hadn't gained weight in many years before), my Dr. told me virtually unavoidable with this class of meds.  I look at it as a necessary evil - I am functioning consistently almost like my old self again.

Before lexapro, out of nowhere I had a breakdown from stress or hormones, not sure, but I was a mess. Very severe anxiety, disorented, thoughts turned scary obsessive.  The beginning of lexapro at 5mg  ok, and then 10mg was too strong (taliing very,very fast etc. like severe caffine)  Lowered to 5 and I'm doing great.  I sometimes feel weird/not like myself, and feels due to the medication.  It can put you in a manic (fast) state of mind.  The anxiety has subsided, but I am afraid to travel far from my doctors because I worry that the drug will flip me out a little.  Exersize is excellent, Lorezepam is excellent just in case and deep breathing great as well.
SIDE EFFECT:  For the entire time, there is a low buzzing/like a radio frequency/ringing that I can hear in the am while waking up and middile of night when up from sleeping (can hear when its quiet)  Doctor not sure, pharmacist not sure.  Blood pressure and physically all tests fine.  "

For Lexapro, my dr. started me on 10 mg, to be increased to 20 mg after 10 days. I took 10 mg for 10 days before stopping. I stopped because I had tremors throughout my body (face, tongue, hands, arms, legs) and mucous diarrhea from day 7-10, as well as increased overall anxiety and panic attacks that were worse than the original anxiety. It has been 5 weeks since I stopped Lexapro, and I now take half a .25 mg Xanax every 2-3 days as needed(at first it was every day). I also have been exercising at least 3 times a week. My anxiety is almost gone now. This regimen is working out much better for me than the SSRIs for now.

In the past I have also suffered from panic attacks, migraines, irratible bowel syndrome, stomach ulcers, etc. -- thus the diagnosis of GAO. 

I was unable to tolerate the full dosage of 20 mg of Lexapro, due to continued feelings of anxiety, difficulty sleeping, nightmares, and a general feeling of ""weirdness"" or ""unrealness"", even though I was taking clonzipene to offset those symptoms.

After 4 months, my doctor finally decided I was too sensitive to Lexapro to take 20 mg and reduced me to 10 mg, as well as prescribing Ambien to help with sleep and nightmares/anxiety dreams.

After another 4 months at 10 mg, I finally feel like a normal person again.  Blood pressure is stabilized, allowing reduction in BP medication.  Feeling of ""weirdness"" has disappeared.  Still have some sleep problems, which I expect to continue as long as I take Lexapro (a decongestant or caffiene will keep me awake all night.)  "

I told my doc I was gaining waight, tired all the time, couldnt sleep at night.  He said ""people that are happy now do gain waight and thats a good thing"" NOT. I cant hold my eyes open at 1:00 in the afternoon and thats when we start surgery at work!  NOT a good time to fall asleep!!!! My dr. office wouldnt give me the weaning dose.  I'm doing as my sister did when she got off of it and will never take anything ever again.  I feel like a drugie needing a fix.  I have to take benadryl to help me sleep at night. 2 cups of coffee to get me up in the morning!  I see tracers with my vision. I quit the stressful job right after I started taking it and love my job now.  I dont need this little white pill. Trying to quit is making me more crazy then when I didnt take it at all.  I say to anyone that reads this DO NOT START TAKING THIS MEDICATION!"

Needless to say, I've tried several other meds and up until now Zoloft or Effexor have been the ones I have been going back and forth w/ every 18-24 months. I was on Lexapro before but it seemed to ""wind me up too much"" and add too the anxiety. But now that I'm taking oxycodone for severe back pain from work injuries, it seems to help w/ the sedating effects of the pain meds and has helped the depression and anxiety."

Notice an increase in wanting to eat, but, can't swear that's also not from my stress. Being aware it can put on weight, I'm trying to watch my junk intake. I do notice a little bit of a fuzzy head feeling in the morning, but, I'm assuming it's part of the first two weeks in acclimating to the medicine.  So far, I am happy with it.  Much, much, MUCH better then the side effects of the Cymbalta.  My hope is not to be on this long term, and I will definitely take my time weaning from this med, after reading the many posts.

I have slight weight gain and in the beginning I felt erectile dysfunction for a month or so but by the time I was back to normal except prolonged ejaculation time.

[he was fine.] they switched me to celexa (a cousin drug) and had nausea and vomiting every day for a month before i boycotted that stuff too.  Behavioral therapy helped me after that, plus being re-diagnosed with PreMentsrual Dysphoric Disorder which the psych docs didn't think to evaluate me for even tho it has coordinating symptoms. now take birth control to alleviate symptoms caused by hormone fluctuations, not serotonin problems like they had thought. i would not recommend lexapro to anyone. i think i almost died."

3767$Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$1/20/2008 7:52:58 AM$Reviewer: Aktta, 13-18 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $3$3$5$Hi! I'm 16 and I have been on this medicine for a few months to treat my social anxiety and depression. The medicine helps a lot with depression and it has improved my depression by about 80%! However, this medicine barely helped with my anxiety. It helps specifically with being happier, more optimistic, and more calm in nervous situations. But overall, it has only improved my anxiety only by about 25%. The side effects are definitely noticeable too. I experienced trouble sleeping, weird dreams (especially nightmares), and low energy. I also had alittle nausea the first time I took it and yawn a lot. Please try to make sure you eat something when you take it, I think it helps. I think overall that I am going to discontinue my use, because the side effects are so great and it didn't help much w/ anxiety, which was the main reason I started taking it. But I still think if you are considering taking it, you should give it a try- results vary so it may work better for you then it did for me. I think you should definitely try it if your problem is depression, because I think it works best for depression- but most people have side effects so you should know although it alleviates depression symptoms, it will probably give you new ones from the side effects. I hope my review helps all of you! =)

I was started on lexapro to get me over the hump and it work amazingly.  Despite how amazing this drug is at treating symptoms, it also comes with a lot of baggage.  When I first started the medicine, I was manic for about 2 weeks, not sleeping, singing all the time, pacing  .. etc.  After all that goodness wore off, I had no sexual appetite and when I did couldn't finish.  After I self dc'd the med (as a sexual relationship is very important), I even tapered off (I know better then to just stop) I was so dizzy I couldn't stand, sit, drive do anything!!!  I was miserable for about a month.  Although this drug worked wonders for me (temporarily), I've had to move onto other things to control my anxiety as I could not deal with all the side effects!  There are other meds out there, don't give up the hope!  Best wishes!

I know that it takes awhile for your body to adjust to a new med but this stuff makes me jittery, unrestful sleep, and my head feels like it weighs 50 lbs. Also despite an interest in sex, and feeling like I want to have sex, I'm unable to climax. So I'm wondering is this going to be worth it? I'm also very concerned about the difficulty in the weaning process, what I've been reading sounds pretty horrible. I think I'll start cutting my pills and stop the madness before I get in any deeper, after all everyone has stress in their life that they have to deal with, right?

Decided to give lexapro a try because it listed less side effects. It was the biggest mistake of my life. I couldn't sleep, my anxiety/panic attacks became more frequent, I became irritable, grouchy, nervous and on edge all the time. My appetite became non existent, I was staying so very sick to my stomach and could not eat. I also developed horrible heartburn that would not go away. I was dizzy and off balance. My doctor switched me back to paxil and ALL of these side effects have subsided. My attacks are now almost non existent, my nerves have calmed down, the heart burn is gone, I can eat and sleep very well now. I would suggest that anyone who is considering the use of this medication to be very careful.

I am having severe headaches, stomach issues, restlessness, anxiety and dizziness.  While I was satisfied for a while on this medication, I suggest to anyone considering it to make sure they do ALOT of research before hand on how hard it is to get off or never plan to quit it.  I hav enever felt so terrible and helpless to control my body in my life.  This withdrawal period has made me hate this drug and I will never put it in my body again.

Normally optimistic, after suffering a bout of insomnia - he became withdrawn and zombie-like. He hid despairing thoughts, and wrote a suicide note 5 days after taking this drug. Three weeks later he killed himself at the age of 58. He had everything to live for and was the last personality type who would commit suicide. This drug can be a killer for certain individuals, especially if they are do not fall into a typical depressed category. His doctor gave him samples ""to help him sleep"". DO NOT LET ANYONE YOU KNOW TAKE THIS DRUG WITHOUT THE CLOSE ATTENTION OF A PSYCHIATRIST. OFTEN PEOPLE, PARTICULARLY MEN, WILL LIE OR HIDE SUICIDAL IMPULSES EVEN WHEN ASKED DIRECTLY (AS I DID). I watched my husband for any signs of suicidal ideation, and there were none. He hid it all. I disliked the zombie quality he was exhitibiting, but I knew that the medicine claims to need weeks to begin to work. THE FACT IS THIS MEDICINE CAN TAKE ONLY 3-5 DAYS TO TURN THE BRAIN CHEMISTRY AROUND TO SUICIDE....My advice: Don't let anyone you know take this drug - there are so many other antidepressants out there with less risk. Lexapro is being pushed as ""safe"" but hundreds of people have committed suicide out of the blue on it. History will record Lexapro as being one of the worst offenders in pandering this drug as safe, when it is clearly not. Sample packages are still being given out casually all over the country. BEWARE THIS DRUG."

4062$Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$11/6/2007 10:49:08 PM$Reviewer: 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$5$5$"I was scared to take it at first because the thought of taking medicine freaked me out, but I took it and it has help keep the anxiety under control at the same time it's not just the medacine, you have to change the way you look at life.  If you're stressed out, work out.  Don't let anxiety take over you!  You can change the way you think and the way you feel.  Change your situation.  It might take a couple of days before you feel ""excellent"" but believe me you will.  Talk yourself out of getting excited.  You have to say ""I feel fine"" and you will realize you do feel fine!  Pray to GOD and ask him to help you to think positive and pray about whatever is stressing you out and GOD will take that stress off of your shoulders and heal you but you have to believe.  Don't just say the words, but believe in him.  Have faith! Everything will work out, you don't have to take the medacine forever.  And when you do ween off, there is a tea not from safeway, but from a chinese shop (look it up online too) where you can go and these teas are for healing not for pleasure.  Working out has truly changed me physically and mentally.  If you don't have time to go to the gym theres so many things you can do from home, just stay encouraged and stress free.  peace and love."

This was from one pill! I didn't sleep at all last night, I had to turn off all the lights and tv so I would overstimulate my eyes, and the diarrhea was still occuring up until a couple hours ago. The doctor suggests I half the dose, but I don't know if its worth going through this nightmare again. If you are sensative to medication I would say be careful about your dosage!

I have both Depression, and Anxiety, too.
Once, we discontinued the Lexapro, to see how I felt, and in a few days, my anxiety was right back, worse than ever! I started the Lexapro, again, and it was gone.
This combination works great for me...
And now that Wellbutrin comes in a once a day dose, and the Lexapro is also once a day, it's very convenient, to take, first thing in the morning, and I'm done! 
Some others I've tried in the past, had to be taken more often, and sometimes I would miss a dose... and that's scary!
So... I give Lexapro a 5-Star rating on all of the criteria above.

Took about 6 weeks on 20mg to get relief, but still get occasional panic attack, but not obsessing about things as much.  As with all treatments, be patient for the drug to work and be sure to seek a therapist/psych-not your regular Dr.  And if the current therapist/psych does not seem to ""fit"", move on to another until you get the right one.  Again be patient and persistent.  Decreased libido, but worth it.  No weight gain.  Some lethargy.  Increased sweating.  Found out that increasing intensity of exercise helps with the anxiety.  Also helps with my minor OCD of excessive cleaning and organizing... now things are messy, but I can live with it. :-)"

4290$Repeated Episodes of Anxiety$9/22/2007 9:46:33 PM$Reviewer:  Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $1$1$1$I switched from paxil to lexapro due to a 20 lb weight gain.  Personally lexapro gave me severe panic attacks and changed my life for the worse.  I finally went to therapy for a year to reverse the panic which I felt was pretty ironic.  I have friends that take lexapro and love it but obviously this is not the right drug for me.

I have been on the medication for more than a year now. I found some of the side effects discomforting, such as weight gain and the electric shock syndrome.  That being said, the positive effects of the drug far outweigh the side effects.  I am able to function and my life is back to ""normal"" for me! "
