39$Schizophrenia$7/15/2009 12:37:03 PM$Reviewer: jasperwalker69, 25-34 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $5$3$5$This drug worked well to control my moods and to reduce psychotic episodes w/hallucinations , however after a week or so on the drug i began having uncontrollable muscle spasms and could not sit in one spot for more than a few minutes at most,this was very frustrating because i could not control the urge to pace around all the time.
40$Schizophrenia$5/14/2009 4:16:10 AM$Reviewer: prozacplease, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $3$2$5$"This is a better treatment for bipolar,
schizophrenia is more of an incureable disease. The mood stablizing that this drug offers is useful when becomeing used to the symptoms associated with schizophrenia... 

It is not a cure all and there is no cure for something that is not caused by an chemical imbalance. However like I said it may ease the emotional symptoms, and cause weight gain etc."

58$Schizophrenia$1/29/2019 3:45:44 AM$Reviewer: BStudent, 45-54 on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $1$1$1$I gained 100 lbs. while on Abilify. I was on the pills first for years, then they switched me to these injections. I went from weighing 145 to 245 lbs. I am miserable, but am FORCED to take this. It is as if it is drying me out in my digestive system: I have been constipated ever since I've been on it, and have to keep a bottle of Milk of Magnesia on hand to relieve that. And I cannot urinate like I used to. The quantity of liquid coming out of me is much less than the amount I drink. The only good thing I can say is that it makes me feel less sleepy than other anti-psychotic medications. I agree with the other reviewer's post: This medication is poison.

I've tried more medicine than I can remember. I always slept more than half the time I was awake. I had no energy and mostly hibernated my life away. I struggled with SI and medication made me gain a lot of weight. Then my dr suggested to add abilify to my medications. 280 degree improvement!! This medicine is a gift from God. I finally live like a normal person. I was on disability for my mental disorders.  Now I wake up early, go to work, and pursue my dreams and goals. I have much fewer psychosis symptoms. I'm basically a normal person now. And I've lost weight and continue to lose extra weight. I'm happy 95 percent of the time and feel calm and confident. Last year to this year you wouldn't even recognize me. This medication saved my life

I've noticed that my schizo. has responded great to this medication along with others to control it. The outcome is wonderful. Be warned, this medication isn't for everyone. It caused me quite a bit of weight gain. This medicine has stopped me from having so many relapses. MY actual diagnosis is Schizoaffective Disorder. I also have acute Bipolar 1. I'm telling you that this medicine works for the right body chemistry. I'm able to think clearer and not be so paranoid or have too many manic attacks. I really pray that this testimony helps someone, anyone. Be blessed.

She was at her worst when we had her transferred to another hospital.  Her new Doctor prescribed abilify and now 6 months later,  we have our mother back to normal.  We NEVER thought she would ever be this good again.  She is 70 and has had Schizophrenia her whole life,  it getting worse the older she got.  She is now the sweet lady we grew up with and again has quality of life.  She is on a small dose and has not gained much weight.  I would recommend this to any patient that has battled this illness with not so great results.

349$Schizophrenia$1/13/2014 5:33:13 AM$Reviewer: Lacey_Lou_Who, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Patient) $4$1$4$I was on this on it my Schizopherina for visual and hearing. It was easy for me to take every morning I was on the highest dose there was. And I gained a lot of weight. My hands are a little shaky any way but it made them more shaky and it was bad enough that I couldn't transfer one thing from one pot to another pot with any liquid when I was cooking. Or even pouring something from one cup to another cup it was that bad. I couldn't sweat in the summer I could never cool down and could never get cool. That is one of its major side effects is you can not sweat. And when I got off this medicine and I started sweating again it felt so weird and being able to cool down for after 5 years it was nice. And I got migraines a lot on this medicine too. Because I couldn't get cooled down from the heat and sweat it out and I would suffer and the higher the dose you are on the worse you will not be able to sweat. So over all I didn't and will not take this medication ever ever again.

History of Diabetes in the family brings concern of sugar spikes caused by Abilify.  Have to really watch diet and exercise. So far I have gained 5lbs in 5 months.  I am not sleeping through the night consistently.  More physical activity is required to do well on this medication and close eye on consuming too many carbs and calories.  Otherwise effective for my symptoms of Schizophrenia.

I incurred a staphlococcus mutation in the 80's when they were illegally storing radiactive barrels close to the nieghborhood,,,
I developed upper palate deformity growing up as a young man, so the orthodontist pulled teeth and reformed my mouth smaller than before, another symptom was asthma... 
anyway the medication prescribed for my symptoms of depression and other radiation induced illness from my youth is this great and wonderful anti-psychotic so I do not go out and seek vengeance on those who ruined my life as a whole man,,,so, I sit and eat my pills and spite the man who dumps his poisons on my childhood. I long for the day when the government will admit the truth about the real cause of cancer and disease from the radioactive waste emitting from the spilled sites that seep deep into the earth effervescing into the air as the rods eat and melt thorough the steel drums, it is no doubt in my mind where cancer comes from and still, we all buy the lies about it and eat the poison pills which make us feel like spasmodically having seizures which are also caused by gamma emitions, well its only 50 thousand years for the half life to start to decay the radiation , see yall at the hospital,,,weeeeeeee

644$Schizophrenia$1/21/2012 5:10:37 PM$Reviewer: B dtr, 65-74 Female  on Treatment for 2 to less than 5 years (Caregiver) $3$1$5$My mom took Abilify and Seroquel for over two years. (She had taken Risperdol before that and had a relapse.) She developed severe tardive dyskensia-mouth twitches, head and hand tremors-and her psych told her that she had Parkinson's. She had become so oversedated that she was nearly catatonic, and had lost all desire to eat or do anything except slump in her chair in front of the TV. She developed aspiration pneumonia and ended up in the hospital, where they had to put in a feeding tube because she could no longer swallow food or liquid. She was seen by a neurologist who correctly diagnosed her with tardive dyskensia--NOT Parkinson's--and put her on Clozeril. After 8 months of suffering, and intensive speech therapy, she is now home, eating regular food, and is more alert and lucid than I've seen her in years.  Please, if you are on either Abilify or Seroquel, and if you are having any symptoms like hers, tell your dr and don't take no for an answer! It's a miracle she's still alive.

So far, it has made me sleep for 12+ hours of the day, feel like my stomach is trying to crawl out of my body, become depressed (when I was not), cry uncontrollably for 3 days and unable to concentrate. I also got the shakes after only day 4 and I am having a difficult time driving, due to blurred vision and lack of concentration. For those of you interested, it also ruined my sex drive. This drug has not helped me for what it was meant to treat. It is more disabling than helpful. Abilify? More like Dis-Abilify.

I read online that Abilify can cause High Blood pressure or Fluctuating blood pressure...my prescriber's office still would not lower my dose...I felt this med was doing more harm than good...I then went to see a neurologist...I was told this medication can cause the dizziness and went back to my prescriber...reluctantly my dose was lowered by 5 mg...the abrupt feeling of faint has not returned by I do still get a feeling of vertigo or dizzy at times...my blood pressure went to borderline...I was told at some point if I could drop some weight this might help...I've been working out in a gym on a treadmill and lifting weights for over a year...the most weight I lost was 10 pounds...I am trying dieting now...I feel I need to ask for my dosage to be lowered again to see if my blood pressure will drop...read online in NY Times article on young adults taking Abilfy...that lowering the dose does not help with weight loss...I will continue to diet and exercise even still...and see about getting the dose to see if my blood pressure will go down...

820$Schizophrenia$1/22/2011 12:53:27 AM$Reviewer: 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $2$1$1$This is the most horrific drug I've ever taken.  My doctor let me try this because the Risperdal I was taking had caused a lot of weight gain, and Abilify is known to cause somewhat less weight gain.  I took it for several months.  It was a terrible experience.  I had one of its most common side effects, which was anxiety and insomnia.  I had constant anxiety just gushing inside my body, and I would be awake all night, over and over again.  I started making fewer and fewer meals and just ate handfuls of peanuts instead just to stay alive because I felt too bad to cook a balanced meal.  I did lose some weight, but the situation got worse, where at 15 mg. I was starting to hear voices again, and I was afraid to ask my doctor to increase the dose because the awful anxiety might have gotten worse.  I finally switched back to Risperdal and later Invega (a slightly improved version of Risperdal), and it was the biggest relief I have ever had in my lifetime.  My sleep immediately went back to normal, no more voices, and the awful gushing anxiety just stopped.  I wish it was easier to lose weight on Invega, but I have had some success in doing so, since it's not like it causes me hunger all the time.  The weight just sort of creeps up on me with these drugs, and it's possible to eat healthy and keep a healthy weight, it just takes some effort.

I'm caring about my appearance again and finding a little motivation. Also, save for a brief breakthrough the other day, the psychosis has eased and I am better able to function. It also helps me be less anti-social in that I actually want to talk to certain people now instead of spending my days alone in my room. Abilify has offered me new hope, and I don't want to kill myself anymore because of that. So far it is the best medicine I have tried.

The only side effects I've had were about 3 days of akathisia upon starting (mild) and moderate nausea on occasion."

As his physician stated recently, because he takes this medication as prescribed, no one would know he has a thought disorder.  It has been a lifesaver for him.  Because it did cause him to crave sugar, and gain weight, our family is on the ""Sugar Busters"" program, and he works out consistently every week. Our family would highly recommend this medication."

It makes me rational and more calm if I'm aggitated. I would recommend a low dose, especially if you are on other medications. It seems to work pretty well with eliminating problems: focusing, depressed mood. While other medications have sometimes worsened my problems, Abilify has really helped me to make progress. I think that the way it works makes it more effective.

Abilify has very minimal side effects (unlike most of the other anti-psychotics); however, it didn't completely quell my symptoms - I still experienced some psychotic feelings.  This is not surprising, however, because Abilify is the newest (and ""weakest"") anti-psychotic.  By ""weakest"" I am referring to the fact that it is only a partial dopamine agonist, which, in some cases, facilitates the manifestation of some psychotic symptoms.  However, for many people, Abilify is a highly efficacious drug.  For me, however, it just wasn't quite strong enough, so I switched to Zyprexa (which quells my psychotic symptoms, but has its own related side effects *see my Zyprexa posting*).  In sum, Abilify is a very gentle drug that is well tolerated by many people.  Given the potential side effects of other anti-psychotic drugs, I would try Abilify as my first line of defense.  Who knows?  It just might work.   "

I have not had to be admitted to the psychiatric hospital for several years now that we have come up with a stable set of medicine for me which includes Abilify, which works very well for me.  I find no problems with taking the pill in the morning and getting on with my day.
