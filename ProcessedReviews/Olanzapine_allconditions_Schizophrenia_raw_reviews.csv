8$Schizophrenia$9/18/2012 2:14:32 PM$Reviewer: kaeksen, 35-44 Male  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $5$5$5$"It has worked 100% in my case. I got back to the one i was prior to my schizophrenic start in the early 90's. Lost 18 of my years, but now im happy :)
In my case i had several voices in my head, either helping me, or wanting to be cruel, or other mal adjusted types of conscious behavior. It was like my connections in my head was not connected as for memory concerned, i had big trouble remembering things. Sometimes hard forming sentences (at the end before i finally gave in to drug treatment, as i realized now its time to try something new.)And i dont regret it at all, it was the start of a new life, with the connections in my brain finally working again as they should.
I would recommend others that have trouble with schizophrenia to try this drug. Dont start of with a big dose 20mg, but start with 7.5mg for a week, then if it doesnt work as good as wanted, try 10mg for another week. For me 10mg was enough, but i realize that i might in the future higher the dose. I've been on 10mg for 2 mnths now, and the 10mg keeps working 95%. I sure hope that i dont have to increase the dossage very much in the future, as i hope it will stablelize atleast with a 15mg dossage.
Its very individual how effective the medisine is, from people to people.
In my case i had far too much production of dopamine, and serotonine (neurotransmitters)
So the meds are ""hindering"" the reseptors to use much of the D&S which i produce, and it gives me calm, and makes my brain/mind whole.
I hope i have contributed some. Sorry 4 my bad english. Take care all. :)"

34$Schizophrenia$12/1/2016 3:11:12 AM$Reviewer: Gomedfree, 19-24 Female  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $1$1$1$"Olanzapine did not work for me, my psychosis symptoms did not improve at all, if anything it made them worse. 

It made me constantly dizzy and very tired. I could barely function, or even keep my eyes open, I would sometimes fall asleep sitting up. Constant napping there was no choice. I felt like a zombie with no feelings or emotions which is worse than my original condition imo. And the worst part is you do not have a sex life when on this medication at all! No desire to have sex, it actually hurts to have sex and it's impossible to orgasm

I was a pretty small person to begin with around 120-125 and I eat a healthy low carb/sugar diet, no processed foods mostly organic fresh vegtables and oils, never over eating. So when my doctor told me that I would probably gain weight I didn't think it would actually happen but I took it for 7 months and I ended up weighing 166! It was so depressing and now I have permanent stretch marks on my body :( I don't take any medication any more and I honestly feel so much better. Also if you research olanzapine it's a pretty dangerous drug and has killed a lot of people.   "
36$Schizophrenia$5/28/2016 9:40:32 PM$Reviewer: Francian, 19-24 on Treatment for 1 to less than 2 years (Patient) $3$1$3$It has made me sleep easier and caused the voices that I was hearing to stop. But it have some side effects. I have gained weight from 141 pounds to 165. It has caused me to gained some breasts and I'm a man. My intelligence have suffered because the decreased brain activity. My brain activity has gone below normal. So I have a harder time at college because of this.
40$Schizophrenia$4/5/2016 11:19:15 PM$Reviewer: maxine dare, 55-64 on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $5$5$5$I took largactil from 1980 - 98 - not a very nice drug and it gave me tardive dystonia - restricted the movement in my neck.  In 1999 a new psychiatrist gave me olanzapine - it made me relaxed with a slight feeling of euphoria - My whole body was relaxed not like the stiffness I had all the years I took largactil - I even got my normal handwriting back!  Olanzapine also helps with sleep - including when an inpatient on a noisy ward. It was a new drug then and my psychiatrist said that some of his patients were calling it a miracle drug. It does increase the appetite - about an hour after a meal I would feel very hungry again.  A doctor said to me watch that - I did not and put 3 stone of weight on.  However my psychiatrist said that after a certain time on olanzapine - at least a year the appetite goes back to normal.  This was true and after a lot of abstinence I lost all the 3 stone in weight.  I would feel very tired early - about 9 pm but at least I got up in the morning easily - when I took largactil it was very hard to get up in the morning.  It is a much better and safer drug.  The only other side effect I noticed was a slight twitch at the side of my mouth - once every 3 or 4 months.  After several years the tardive dystonia improved somewhat.  Sadly, when I went to hospital for a rest and to avoid the kids smashing my windows in 2011 - so I was not ill - I offended the psychiatrist (different man from before) and the staff so they forced on me risperidone knowing it was a torture and made me stay on it for months.  It did horrid things to my body, made the tardive dystonia worse again and took away all sleep.  That psychiatric ward should be closed down because the staff are very cruel. However the drug Olanapine was great for me.

Since I started on taking this about 8 or 9 months ago, I have had some major changes. On the positive I see fewer ""shadows"" and hear fewer things. I take a combination of medications and have for over 15 years. My family and I, all noticed the change for the better, after about 3 months of adding this to my regimen. I would recommend this to anyone that suffers from some of the same issues. The worst thing about it, to me is the weight gain; it's been drastic for me. I gained about 15 to 20 pounds in the first 2-3 months. I have always had an ""over active"" metabolism, but this is the first time in my life I've been overweight. I feel the effect it's had for me is worth the weight gain; it's the 1st medication that has had a major effect other then Prozac. I just have to exercise a little more than before. "

I kept running away. it did not change that I was raped and strangled by my coworker and held pics for ransom. which I refused to tell anyone at the time. Not a cop or doctor.  but as far zyprexa no one nobody mentioned the too hot too cold. if you are going on this drug; wear a sweater and a t-shirt. you can take off the sweater; on and off on and off. im so depressed; as I no longer smoke. I cant get a drag. don't want sex.no anxiety pills don't work at all might as well be baby aspirin. I am working with my doctor to wake up the pleasure zone in my brain. I just started latuda not sure yet my hand shakes. and he told me I would not gain weight. ps - if you need help go to your doctor. it was impossible to get out, until my insurance ran out

Lock it up in a box, not just ""out of reach"". My child took too much and we didn't know it because it made her sleepy along with some of her other meds. It can increase suicidal thoughts and actions. It's hard to remove from the body or reverse the affects. By the time we realized she had taken an overdose it was too late. "

I never thought I needed the drug but my doctors pushed it and not knowing any better I complied. I had been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder and drugged unbelieveably up to the point where I couldnt feel, think or relate to others. I slept all day everyday and gained 70 pds. I thought "" is this what i want from my life?"" Slowly I weaned off the Zyprexa and Celexa and others and stayed on the lithium since its a salt not a drug. learning that my asshole father pressured the doctors all these years to keep me sedated b/c of his sexual abuse to me. Ive been good so far. Trouble sleeping but it gets better. Im under therapy and still see a doctor but I have a second chance in life.

260$Schizophrenia$5/15/2011 8:35:50 AM$Reviewer: KimUri, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for less than 1 month (Patient) $1$1$2$I was falsely diagnosed as schizophrenic due to some issues back in High school, but was forced to either take this or be submitted to the hospital. While on it, I gained 20lbs, nearly strangled my sister to death, and hallucinated some of the most horrifying things I have ever saw in my life. If you do not have the psychosis a medication is meant to help fix, DO NOT take it, regardless of legal issues as its side effects will outlast any legal trouble. It's a small pill, so not hard to swallow, but not only made my depression worse, but it put me through some of the most horrifying times of my life. Between the hallucinations I saw (even knowing it wasn't real barely helped) and the fact I was barely able to control myself from killing someone while on this medication, I advise any and everyone to stay as far away from this medication as possible. I don't know if it actually works for people who ACTUALLY have schizophrenia or not, but if you don't, you'll know after only a couple doses that this medication is not for you. Also note, the hallucinations last far after you quit taking the medication... thankfully the blind rage did not. Please be careful when on any anti-psychotic medication, especially Zyprexa or any form of this specific medication.

As i noticed with the zyprexa it operates on a different part of the brain non releaving of psycological problems.  The zyprexa feels as though it's providing extra molecules non needed.  I think that alot of the information about schizophrenia on this site is wrong and im only basing this on personal strong facts.

425$Schizophrenia$4/29/2009 9:44:40 PM$Reviewer: 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $2$1$4$I was put on this medication to help with my Schizophrenia. After 3 weeks I was having severe cramping of my legs along with edema so bad I could barely put my shoes on. For the first 2 weeks I was so groggy in the morning I could barely function. It did slowly get a little better after that. I made an appointment with my doctor and needless to say the horror on my face when I stepped on the scale and saw in that short time I had gained 15 lbs!! My doctor put me on another medication called Seroquel. I have read it has side effects the same as Zyprexa but so far I am doing much better on my current meds. So I wish all well and hope this helps someone.

She feels fine, in her head, but has no friends, jobs and sleeps more and more.  She is getting very big, put about l0 to 15 pounds every year.  She is so big, that is a concern. has a bad back and trouble walking.  She is now 50.   yrs. old.  She used to be slim, full of energy and very, very bright.

455$Schizophrenia$2/2/2009 6:05:20 PM$Reviewer: concerned, 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 10 years or more (Patient) $1$1$5$I was on Zyprexa for 13 years.  I got off of it because I had this hollow feeling all the time.  I was constantly exhausted/tired.  Extreme difficulty of functioning/taking care of myself and my son.  Weight gain was horrendous.  Went from 120lbs to 205lbs gaining 45lbs within a month and rapidly gained after that.  I believe it caused my diabetes.  I regret taking this medication!  I never had long periods of symptoms(hearing things,being paranoid).  This drug in actuality for me did nothing but ruin my health and my life.  I suggest to anyone not to take this medication.

475$Schizophrenia$11/30/2008 7:00:03 PM$Reviewer: Krys, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 1 to 6 months (Patient) $4$3$5$Pretty effective, but I still can't sleep at night. I haven't gained more than 20 pounds but I was underweight so I'm not worried. I haven't slept through the night in three weeks so it's not working as well as it originally did.

512$Schizophrenia$7/17/2008 11:56:49 PM$Reviewer: $5$5$5$I have taken 10mgs of zyprexa for ten years.  It really changed my life profoundly for the better.  I am very happy that I found   zyprexa because I am able to live a fairly normal life.  It is really effective.  Weight issue are a problem but it can be controlled with diet and exercise.  I will probably take it as long as it is available.  My quality of life is immensely improved as a result of zyprexa.

527$Schizophrenia$5/7/2008 12:14:24 AM$Reviewer: $5$5$5$This is a scary drug. My mother has been on it for 5 years.  About 3 years ago her doctor decided to take her off of it.  This was unsuccessful and she ended up in the hospital where she stayed for weeks and they ended up giving her ECT treatments because they could not get her out of her psychotic behavior.  She was put back on Zyprexa and will have to stay on it for the rest of her life. She has been stable since then but tying to come off of it is scary.

544$Schizophrenia$2/10/2008 6:50:50 PM$Reviewer: bjr28, 19-24 Male  on Treatment for 6 months to less than 1 year (Patient) $5$4$5$I took this drug for 8 - 9 months, but I switched to another anti-psychotic because of its side effects.  Here is the deal with Zyprexa: Now, I am no psychiatrist (although I feel like one after experimenting with different medications for the past 18 months), but, after a great deal of research and personal experience, I can safely say that Zyprexa is the most efficacious anti-psychotic on the market.  HOWEVER, you will gain a ton of weight (which could lead to diabetes and other related problems) if you are not careful.  I am a former athlete, and I exercise for at least an hour every day, and I put on about 20 lbs. while taking this drug.  From what I understand, most people put on much more than that!  So, essentially, Zyprexa is the best drug for schizophrenia (even better than Haldol and the other first generation drugs); however, the side effects can be very serious.  I advise carefully considering your diet/exercise routine before beginning to take this drug.  Simply put, it is the most efficacious anti-psychotic out there...just be careful.
