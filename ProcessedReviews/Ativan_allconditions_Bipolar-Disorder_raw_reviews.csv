This one does not make me feel like a zombie or sleepy I'm on .5mg and take only when I feel my anxiety attacks coming on or bad restless legs both of which within 10-15 mins are gone. I do take this only when needed am on two other meds that work together for my bipolar and severe migraines. Have been on these meds for several years now. I finally feel in control!!

I was then diagnosed with Bipolar disorder as a young adult and it has really helped with that too. I usually take one at bedtime and then up to 2 others anytime throughout the day. Ativan has been a Godsend. But... if you are on a high dose it is imperative that you back down slowly- it can be very scary if you don't reduce usage one step at a time.

I have a high tolerance to benzo's, though, so you should start out at a low dosage and figure out what it best for you. I now take 5 mg a day and I function fine.

806$Mania associated with Bipolar Disorder, Adjunct Treatment$9/2/2008 11:09:18 AM$Reviewer: $1$1$1$"This medication was prescribed for my 11 year old son. He has bipolar disorder - my warning is read ALL the side effects - even the RARE ones - Ativan made him mean. He became a child we did not recognize. At one point he became like a baby sitting in the kitchen throwing things and grunting. He had horrible muscle pains - screaming and hollaring in pain. It was torture!
READ ALL THE SIDE EFFECTS before you take or give to a loved one. "

934$Mania associated with Bipolar Disorder, Adjunct Treatment$1/27/2008 10:06:37 AM$Reviewer: knightsaber1, 25-34 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $3$1$3$The first few times I used this as a PRN, it worked quite well and very quickly. Unfortunately, I would find later that I would have yet another episode (often worse) exactly 24 hours later. To me, this was a sign of withdrawal, as the subsequent attacks were otherwise unprovoked. I've heard of how addictive this drug is, and using it caused me to spiral into a pattern that I would not have gone into had I simply taken a hot bath. So nowadays, if I do have a moment, I take a low dose of Diazepam (Valium) instead.

1229$Mania associated with Bipolar Disorder, Adjunct Treatment$5/5/2012 10:08:38 AM$Reviewer: Drug Addict , 35-44 Female  on Treatment for 5 to less than 10 years (Patient) $1$1$5$I was on .5 mg 1-3 per day for over 5 years.  I took this with Celexia & Trazadone which caused me to pass out and drive off a cliff.  My dr. discontinued these drugs all at once and I suffered severe withdrawal symtoms which at the time I did not know were Benzo withdrawals and I was diagnosed as Bi-polar II and put on Lamictal, Trazadone, Neurontin, Celexia, and Cymbalta all together which reacted with the previous lorazepam and put me into a coma.  This has been the most horrifying, painful experience I have ever been through with these drugs, and will never recommend them to anyone.
